Even if we have the option of trying it on, we may not find any size that fits well. We may have to shop in a department that doesn\u2019t have the type of items we need, such as a tall woman forced to shop in menswear or a small person forced to shop in child -\nrenswear department. Being small doesn\u2019t mean you want to wear girly pink frilly knickers!\nThis is also a big problem for retailers who must decide how many of each size to \nbuy and stock for good sales with minimal waste. For online shopping, fit problems result in returns with extra shipping costs. Shipping costs have gotten to be so high that some online apparel companies have been offering to refund a large part of the cost of the product rather than paying for the return shipping! Fit is not only a prob -\nlem for fashion apparel but even more difficult for protective equipment or special wearables, such as helmets, eyeglasses, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) masks, and nitrile gloves, which we may purchase only once or infrequently. This problem exists with larger cost implications for organizations, such as hospitals, fire departments, law enforcement agencies, or the military, having to acquire sizes in large quantities.\nWhy, after hundreds of years of collecting body measurements, decades of three-\ndimensional (3D) human scanning and biomechanical modeling, and numerous text -\nbooks on engineering anthropometry, are we still having problems with fit? The reason is a lack of fit data and no guidebook that explains how to get it. There is no database of fit test results and no resource that tells us reliably what product pro -\nportioning will fit a given body. The proportioning and sizing for fit success varies depending upon the design, the materials, the target population, the intended func-tion of the product, the style, the other products with which it must interface, and more.\nThis book describes the process needed to design and assess wearable products \neffectively and select the best sizes for any population or any individual. We refer to it as the Sustainable Product Evaluation, Engineering, and Design (SPEED) process. The secret to good fit and product functionality is to measure, validate, and docu -\nment early and throughout the development of the product, who we fit, how well we fit them, and how they relate to our intended wearer population. With this infor -\nmation, it is possible to make informed decisions about the design, the adjustment mechanisms (such as the type and number of pads, elastic straps, lacing, and belts), the number and assortment of sizes, and more to best accommodate your target mar -\nket with the least amount of sizes and cost.\nThe authors, with 125 years of combined experience, have put together this text -\nbook to capture and document the best methods and to help others learn from their experience. This is the book we wish we had had, first when we were just starting out in the business, then to use as a quick reference for procedures we only use", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3178, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "983f2ab4-fbc1-49ca-86a5-eaede8d4b718": {"__data__": {"id_": "983f2ab4-fbc1-49ca-86a5-eaede8d4b718", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "viii", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "92984aa7-0b65-4cd7-bded-c0fe81c65209", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "viii", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "dad9b720dafc2210d5daf6a01bad4e16579c532ad3105a4287cf8daad8a3711b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "viii Preface\noccasionally, and finally to use a textbook for our students and for co-workers who \nwere carrying on our work.\nWe have spent more than three years pulling all the materials together and test -\ning our processes and descriptions to ensure they work well for all types of products \nand industries.

It is a guide to help designers, manufacturers, retailers, and procurement organizations:\n\u2022Solve the persistent fit problems\n\u2022Maintain a good fit for all styles of a wearable product and across all sea-sons or iterations\n\u2022Optimize the sizes manufactured or purchased by:\n\u2022Aligning the sizes with the target market\n\u2022Adding missing sizes and\n\u2022Eliminating redundant or unnecessary sizes\n\u2022Communicate the range of fit in each size effectively\n\u2022Predict correct sizing for individuals based on body measurements\n\u2022Ensure products we buy for our store or organization will fit our wearers,and\n\u2022Make design, size, and fit decisions with confidence\nIn this chapter, we introduce the overarching systems engineering approach to \nwearable design that we refer to as the Sustainable Product Evaluation, Engineering, and Design (SPEED) process. The process is illustrated with a diagram that serves as a roadmap for the book, intended to help the reader understand where they are in the process and where to find the information needed to perform each part effectively.\nNearly everyone has experienced fit problems with a wearable product at one or \nother time in their life. It is not only a problem for fashion apparel but is even more difficult for protective equipment or special wearables, such as helmets, eyeglasses, Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) masks, wearable technology, and nitrile gloves, which we may purchase only once or infrequently and where the fit is critical to its intended use. This problem exists with larger cost implications for organizations, such as hospitals, fire departments, law enforcement agencies, or the military, having to acquire sizes in large quantities. Even if we have the option of try -\ning it on, we may not find any size that fits well. We may have to shop in a department that doesn\u2019t have the type of items we need, such as a small person forced to shop in the childrenswear department, or a tall woman forced to shop in menswear. Being small doesn\u2019t mean you want to wear girly pink frilly knickers!1", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2337, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95d76448-7ba4-43c1-9983-db67973dbff7": {"__data__": {"id_": "95d76448-7ba4-43c1-9983-db67973dbff7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ede464bb-9d53-4119-9ac5-ce6395a495f2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "006b26631c6b91f8dcafc357337a425ff5cfee5fc5108209d8cf2eebcff7e391", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "2 Product Fit and Sizing\nThis is also a big problem for retailers, who must decide how many of each size to \nbuy and stock. For online shopping, shoppers do not have confidence that the product \nthey buy will fit, and fit problems result in returns with extra shipping costs. Shipping \ncosts have gotten to be so high that some online apparel companies have been offer -\ning to refund a large part of the cost of the product rather than paying for the return \nshipping! These products end up in the garbage dump.\nThe United States\u2019 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) measures the gen -\neration, recycling, composting, combustion with energy recovery, and landfilling \nof textile materials in municipal solid waste (MSW) and publishes the findings on \nthe official website ( EPA, 2020 ). In 2017, they estimated that clothing and footwear \nindustries in the United States generated 12.8 million tons of MSW, 8.9 million tons \nof which ended up in landfills. Only 1.7 million tons were recycled. The amount due \nto wasted sizes is not known, but there is a lot of room for improvement. Kay Liu \n(2018)  estimated the \u201cfashion and textile industry sees a loss of over $500 billion \nthrough the take-make-dispose production and consumption model\u201d. She stated, \u201cAn \nenormous 80% of the environmental impact is decided at the design stage\u201d. While \nthis number is debatable, we agree that there is a huge opportunity for bringing more \nsustainable products to market via \u201cbetter\u201d design.\nAnyone who is dealing with sizing in the apparel industry today knows that there are \nstill many problems with sizing and fit. For example, in 2019 Emma Spedding (2019)  \nspoke about the industry\u2019s sizing problem. She interviewed editors, designers, model \nbookers, and curve models about fit and sizing and they acknowledged there are still \nsubstantial fit and sizing problems, but they are not clear about how to solve them. Some \nof them felt that they were missing sizes because they were getting so many returns, \nsome thought they might need sizes between the sizes they had because of different \nproportioning, and some noted that they needed to change but grading is not easy. At \nleast one person felt they were missing out on billions of pounds by not getting it right.\nAll the commentators agreed there are many problems, but equally, each commen -\ntator had differing opinions on how to solve them, and no evidence that their proposed \nsolution would work. This is because they had insufficient evidence about the source \nof the problem. Poor data and lack of evidence about the source of the problem lead \nto bad sizing decisions. We don\u2019t want you to think that more in-between sizes aren\u2019t \nneeded because sometimes they are. However, if they are, we still need to know where \nand how to create the sizes so they fit people who otherwise would have no fit. We \ngive a method you can systematically apply to find the causes of individual problems, \nunderstand them and thus, solve them. We show worked examples of different design \nand sizing solutions in the subsequent chapters. For example, if the problem is miss -\ning sizes, then the correct answer is more sizes, or if the problem is overlapping or \nduplicate sizes then the correct answer is fewer sizes. Often, the solution is the same \nnumber of sizes but with the base size and grading shifted slightly to fit more custom -\ners optimally. All problems are not the same and equally, all solutions are not the same.\nAfter decades of research and development experience, we have learned the \nsecret to successful fit and sizing is to measure, validate, and document early and \nthroughout the development of the product, who you fit, how well you fit them , and \nhow they relate to your intended wearer population . With this information, it is \npossible to make informed decisions about the design, the adjustment mechanisms", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3880, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f10e424-0d7d-4842-a48f-f4594f6f6945": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f10e424-0d7d-4842-a48f-f4594f6f6945", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cdad6f92-bc14-4169-89af-e0a05c3f4006", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "f26e5bf3211c1ff1bb2ca70cb087ec8698ccf074838772b9c6699cf7237ccde7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "3 Introduction\n(such as the type and number of pads, elastic straps, lacing, and belts), the number \nand assortment of sizes, and more, to best accommodate your target market with the least amount of sizes and cost.\nA word about standards. A universal sizing standard should not be confused with a \nuniversal good outcome for consumers. All brands should aim to have a universal good outcome for their shoppers, which means that clothing fits their intended target cus -\ntomer. We call the target customer or user the Target Population  or TP. A universal siz -\ning standard would mean that all garments labeled, say size 12, would fit the same size people. So, to use Emma\u2019s example, if a shopper went to Top Shop and Saint Laurent then they could walk in and both fit a size 12 in each shop. This makes sense if the tar -\nget customer is the same for both brands. However, groups of target customers differ in products and geography, and therefore a universal sizing standard should be optional. On the other hand, internal fit standards as part of a quality control suite inside each company ensure each new style fits their target customer and are completely essential!\nFor designers and engineers of completely new wearable innovations, this book \nhelps ensure their first product on the market will effectively fit their TP with less wasted sizes or design components. It enables them to scale the business to other regions or demographics, avoiding failures due to poor adaptation to the new target market. Poor fitting wearable technology not only leads to wasted cost in unneces -\nsary sizes, or lost sales due to poor accommodation of portions or whole demograph -\nics groups, but also ultimately, poorly fitted wearable technology could lead to loss of productivity, errors, or safety-critical failures.\nFor products that are already on the market, this book helps future iterations min -\nimize waste and maximize the percentage of the market accommodated. It explains how to develop a company standard that is maintainable for new styles, new seasons, or new product iterations. We refer to this as the sustainable fit standard.\nFor organizations that purchase large quantities of uniform or standard equipment \nand apparel, such as hospitals and firefighters, this provides an effective method for evaluating the suitability of wearable products for their population, ensuring better fitting products and minimizing workplace injuries caused by poor design or sizing.\nSUSTAINABLE PRODUCT EVALUATION, ENGINEERING,  \nAND DESIGN PROCESS\nThe Sustainable Product Evaluation, Engineering, and Design (SPEED) process is \nillustrated in Figure 1.1 . There are three main sections: (1) inputs, (2) the design loop, \nand (3) the sizing loop. The inputs section is shown at the upper left of the diagram, and the design and sizing loops are shown in the center, with the design loop being the outer loop and the sizing loop the inner loop. We look at this process when we are starting with a general idea about what product we want to design on the outer loop, then through iterative testing, narrowing down our options and refining the design until we arrive at the final product in all its sizes and configurations.\nIn Figure 1.1 , we present the entire process and the basic order in which the steps \noccur as if we are starting from the beginning of a product design. If we are working with a new product or product type, we might need to start this process at the begin -\nning, establishing requirements, the concept of how it should fit, the TP, etc. However,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3567, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4734793-8d50-4097-9a50-f1289df446a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4734793-8d50-4097-9a50-f1289df446a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5ae417d3-448a-47b2-b2c8-8d64c0f5dfdf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "0382a9940014ae6102a93eb07cc0e5a0a9e8628fa4e2b531ed10bb3347a11afd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "4 Product Fit and Sizing\nFIGURE 1.1  Sustainable Product Evaluation, Engineering, and Design (SPEED) process.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 109, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60fecf06-d336-46f2-8ab8-73ce923450b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "60fecf06-d336-46f2-8ab8-73ce923450b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9d89af1a-50a2-4645-983a-80159299c211", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "e3ecb353c233e9ff92c6cc172678f700125b11b5e10a48893a25e68e7a0a9c86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "5 Introduction\nit is common to use the process at different points, depending on the maturity of the \nproduct and for companies with existing products, or for organizations who are simply purchasing products for their workforce it may only be necessary to use parts of the process. For example, if we are working with an established company that already has existing products and a fit model representing the base size some of the first steps have already been done. If they have never done a prototype fit test, we might start the process by evaluating their fit concepts [we call this the Concept-of-Fit (COF)], using a pilot test and then, when the procedures are finalized, begin a fit audit.\nPilot tests  are pre-experiment guidance tests that evaluate our test procedures \nbefore we begin testing. We include pilot testing at two points in our process; once early in the design loop and once between the design loop and the sizing loop. The former ensures we are on the right track as we begin, and the latter is to ensure some -\nthing hasn\u2019t changed as the product evolved.\nThe COF is a description of how the product should fit and how to evaluate the fit. \nThe initial COF is usually a part of the design concept and is often not documented but is instead just an idea in the mind of the designer. The finalization of the COF requires input from the manufacturer and any stakeholders to ensure that some important aspect of fit is not overlooked or misrepresented and to ensure everyone agrees. This is best done by having all stakeholders (such as designers, buyers, quality assurance people, patternmakers, human factors people, user-interface people, and senior management) observe fit assessment against the COF on test subjects and have them sign off on it when possible. This ensures there is no misunderstanding to be discovered at the end when it is too late. This fit assessment is usually one part of the pilot test.\nWe have a more detailed discussion of the COF in Chapter 2 , where we discuss \nwhat makes a good COF and what to avoid. We also have COF examples in Chapters 5 \nthrough 7 .\nA fit audit is an assessment of an existing product to determine if the sizing is \nsuitable as is or needs to change to accommodate the TP. This will tell us if we can drop some sizes, add sizes, or adapt our size range to accommodate more people in the same number of sizes.\nWe usually like to begin each fit audit with a pilot test to ensure everyone is \nclear and on the same page about what constitutes a good fit, and to verify that our measurements and questionnaires are capturing what we need. While the COF may seem good on paper, when we see it applied to people with varying body sizes, we often find we need to make changes or refinements. The audit might then go through a design loop with prototype fit testing or skip the design loop and go to the sizing loop. This depends on our confidence in the design and the reason we are doing the audit. For example, if the organization evaluating the fit is not the manufacturer and will not have the option of changing the design there is no need to go through a design loop. The sizing loop will identify design flaws as well as indicate which sizes to obtain or purchase or even indicate if a product is worth purchasing at all.\nFor some mature products, the manufacturer might have a fit standard. A fit stan -\ndard  is part of a suite of quality control and quality assurance standards. Its function \nis to ensure consistency in fit and sizing between styles within a brand or company. It includes such things as body measurements, blocks/slopers, manikins, pattern measurements, human models, grading, and CAD models.

In Chapter 5 , we have an example of an apparel item, a woman\u2019s pant, that \nstarted the process with COF ideas, went through a few pilot tests and a prototype fit test to improve the product, conducted a full fit test to optimize the sizing, and finally arrived at a sustainable fit standard for follow-on styles and seasons.\nFor new designs or items, some parts of the design loop are typically repeated \nmany times as the design matures. For example, trade studies are done for every design change that might impact fit, such as new components or materials. Sometimes these are done as part of a prototype fit test and sometimes they are done as stand-alone trade studies. When a trade study test indicates the need for a design change, the process might skip back to the \u201cmodify product\u201d step after the test. If we know there is a need for a design change, there is no need to establish the range of fit or map against the TP until the change is made and tested. We move to establish the range of fit once we are confident in our design. If components or materials we had planned to use are determined to be too expensive or no longer available, we may have the need for a trade study after a product has already gone through sizing assessment. In this scenario we might skip right to a quick stand-alone trade study of the candidate materials to select the new one. If the new item does not change the fit, there may be no need to do additional prototype or sizing loop fit tests.\nInputs\nBy inputs, we refer to all the things that might be needed before starting the design \nor evaluation. This is the subject of Chapter 2 . Inputs are divided into three groups:\n\u2022Product\n\u2022Resources\n\u2022TP\nThe product group inputs are knowledge about the product requirements, con-\nstraints, design concepts, and the initial COF. Things such as per item cost limita-tions, manufacturability, user requirements, product performance requirements, or key performance indicators (KPIs) are included in this group.\nThe resources group inputs include data collection tools, personnel and their \ntraining, data collection logistics, facilities needed, and database management and maintenance plans. Database management and maintenance plans are often over -\nlooked when an organization initiates testing. It can become a nightmare to try to organize all the many datasets collected over time or to track the decisions made as a result of testing. It is best to plan for collating and grouping data from the start. This not only enables easier searching for data and test results but also helps track design changes and the reasons behind them.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3314, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29a48b38-eedd-440c-84d8-84551c33ac81": {"__data__": {"id_": "29a48b38-eedd-440c-84d8-84551c33ac81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bfdf04a0-4994-4c14-849c-6085e760030c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "7186315701724e5ee53e70d59bedbe68a4b7bf2a8842b8c71f1667c940386c76", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "7 Introduction\nThe TP group of inputs includes the demographic and anthropometric description \nof the TP as well as data resources to be used. Data resources can include both exist -\ning samples and plans for collecting new samples from the TP.\nDesIgn Loop\nThe design loop has two parts: (1) case selection with prototyping and (2) testing. It \nbegins with case selection. The Human Factors and Ergonomics Society\u2019s publication \n\u201cGuidelines for Using Anthropometric Data in Product Design\u201d ( Dainoff et al., \n2004 ) introduces the concept of cases. A case is a single individual to be represented \nin a product design or evaluation. This representation can take three forms: (1) a list of measurements of an individual, (2) a 3-D (or 4-D) model of an individual, or (3) the actual individual. The actual individual is called a fit model or a live model. Often all three representations are used.\nChapter 3  covers the first three steps in the design loop and presents comprehen -\nsive details for selecting, representing, and using cases. This includes:\n\u2022 Identifying base size cases with raw data or aggregate data\n\u2022 How to select key variables\n\u2022 How to use bivariate analysis and plots\n\u2022 How to do and understand a PCA analysis\n\u2022 How to compute and use z-scores\n\u2022 Selecting additional cases and grading\n\u2022 How to do and use multivariate regression\n\u2022 Representing cases with physical or digital models\n\u2022 Using cases\nThe rest of the design loop consists of testing to inform the design. We use a loop \nrather than a straight line because we continue to iterate the design until we are satis -\nfied with its fit and performance. As we learn about the product, and what works and what doesn\u2019t for our TP, we modify and improve our design.\nThere are three types of design loop tests: (1) pilot tests, (2) trade studies, and (3) \nprototype fit tests. We present them in this order because it is the order of simplest and easiest to most complex and challenging. This is not necessarily the order in which they need to be done. Tests are done when a decision is needed, and it is com -\nmon for unscheduled decisions to be needed. In other words, the complete design loop is not necessarily fully completed before a design modification is made and a new design loop iteration started. If the first pilot test reveals the need to make immediate changes or adjustments, the remaining steps in the design loop would be skipped and the design loop would restart beginning with modification or redesign of the product or procedure. This is true for subsequent steps as well. If changes are determined necessary at the conclusion of a step in the design loop some of the follow-on steps might be skipped until the change is made and the loop starts again with the modified mock-up or prototype. The design loop should also start again if there are changes for reasons other than fit and performance issues, such as manufac -\nturability or material cost if these things are believed to affect fit.\nTrade studies are simple comparisons of a small number of treatment options, such \nas paddings with different firmness, or two different types of adjustment mechanisms,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3152, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3a5a736-3490-49c3-affd-8940489f0d1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3a5a736-3490-49c3-affd-8940489f0d1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "61a94c37-9aba-4fac-9972-6d99cc783756", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "39182e1d61404b1d85ca14e99aa7059f56ce662ef60644b7f360e765521094a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "8 Product Fit and Sizing\nfor the purpose of narrowing down design options. A trade study can be done as a stand-\nalone test or can be done as part of a larger prototype fit test. Doing a stand-alone trade study can enable us to drop some of the options before doing a larger more complex test.\nPrototype fit tests incorporate some of the same tests as trade studies and more. \nWhile simple trade studies of some components may not depend on fit, prototype systems do. That means body size and shape are necessary factors, the analysis is more complex, and usually, there are many different analyses needed corresponding to the different aspects of fit according to the COF. Prototype fit tests determine how well the product is performing for all types of people in our TP. This will usually require more subjects than we need in the trade studies testing.\nIf there are fit issues, we analyze them and determine how to resolve them, either with \ndesign changes or sizing changes. If the changes needed will substantially modify the system, it may be necessary to redesign or modify before examining the range of fit in the first size or sizes. If the first size or sizes seem to fit some people well, then we examine who is fit and who is not, to understand the range of fit in the first size or sizes. If the first size or sizes need to be adjusted, then these changes will be made, and the new size or sizes evaluated again. If, on the other hand, there are no major issues that need addressing except for finalizing sizes, then the wearable is ready to move to the sizing loop.\nWhen the testing reveals that the design concept is feasible, it is time to analyze \nthe range of fit within a size and use that range to map the size against the TP sample. This is called fit mapping . Fit mapping reveals if the sizes are well-placed and if \nthere is a need for additional sizes or adjustments. If the first size falls at a spot that is off from the main part of the population it is sometimes necessary to modify the product in a major way and re-start the design loop. If it appears to be in a reasonable location, then the process moves to the finalization of the COF and the creation of any additional sizes or adjustments.\nChapter 4  has step-by-step procedures, experimental design, and statistical analy -\nsis methods for all testing. This includes the testing in the design loop and testing in the sizing loop.\nsIzIng Loop\nThe sizing loop uses fit testing of the final product in at least one size along with sam -\npling from the TP to determine the best size assortment and adjustability features. The final full fit test is done in the sizing loop with fit mapping against the TP. The purpose of the design loop is to optimize the design. The purpose of the sizing loop is to verify that the sizes and adjustments are effective and to optimize the sizes and adjustment mechanisms. By the time we arrive at the sizing loop, we should have a mature design that we are confident is good. For the sizing loop, we should have a complete and func-tional product with all components and functional features.\nThe sizing loop is where fit audits and most size validations are done. The out -\ncomes of the sizing loop are:\n\u2022 Validated product fit in all sizes\n\u2022 Size prediction algorithms, charts, and procedures\n\u2022 Tariffs (how many of each size to produce, purchase, or stock)\n\u2022 Sustainable fit standards for future styles, or product iterations", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3445, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9a3b34c-73e0-4d29-8307-569cdfe33873": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9a3b34c-73e0-4d29-8307-569cdfe33873", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7ad4ef56-3673-43d2-9f81-07376a32dc03", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "76bcde3a917fcc7601851d94d5b90b37ce66f57999a1fa7f4855cc789d15fc9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "9 Introduction\nA sustainable fit standard  is a fit calibration framework that is used as part of the \nquality control process to ensure the fit is maintained for all products of a type. It is \nessential to ensure a consistently good fit for the TP while minimizing unnecessary sizes and size duplication. It is determined and defined after a fit audit and may be redefined if the TP changes, the company changes its brand identity, or the product is sufficiently different in some way that may require a new fit audit.\nIf an effective sustainable fit standard has been defined (based on the results of \nprior testing), the fit to the TP can be maintained with mini-fit tests of the prototypes for new product styles, or versions.\nWhenever a new product is developed the developer makes some assumptions \nabout how many and which sizes will be needed. We have found that this assump -\ntion is almost always flawed, even for products that have existed for a long time. For example, Robinette and Veitch (2016)  illustrate how the apparel industry\u2019s most used \ngrade could be adjusted very slightly and would accommodate 15% more of the TP, which represents more than a 40% improvement in sales opportunities. The sizing loop not only tests the assumptions but also permits the developer to make informed decisions about whom to fit, whom to risk not fitting, and how to adjust the product to improve it. This might be an improvement for just one product, or it could be documented in a new sustainable fit standard for multiple products.\nAfter the design loops are complete and the COF is finalized, the sizing loop begins \nwith the creation of any additional sizes deemed necessary from the design loop test -\ning. Next, a full fit test is done. This test will typically have the greatest number of subjects and sufficient representation from each demographic category in the TP.\nThe full fit test results, particularly the range of body measurements that fit for each \nsize, are mapped against a body measurement sample from the TP to create the fit map. The fit map is used to determine the percentages accommodated in each size, the degree of overlap in the sizes, and the degree to which the TP is covered with the entire size assort -\nment. It should be noted that the fit test results can be mapped against many different TPs provided the demographic categories for each were tested. For example, if the original TP was estimated to be 80% under age 30 and 20% over age 30 but it was later learned the TP would be 50% under age 30 and 50% over age 30 the results can be re-weighted to represent the new percentages. If the original population was from the United States, but the product will now be sold in Australia the fit results can be mapped against an Australian sample.\nFit mapping enables risk assessments for dropping sizes, spreading sizes further \napart, and adding sizes. In other words, it allows informed assessment of which users will not be able to obtain a good fit if a size is omitted and thus whose business may be lost. This can be compared to the cost of producing the size.\nFit mapping test results and TP maps are also used to create size selection charts \nand prediction equations that will assist the user in obtaining the correct size in an easy-to-understand manner. This makes it easier for marketing to communicate sizing more accurately to both new and existing customers and improve customer confidence for internet sales.\nExperimental designs, sampling and test procedures for the sizing loop testing are \nprovided in Chapter 4 . This includes how to map against the TP, how to create size \nselection charts, and how to create size prediction equations.\nAn example of the use of the sizing loop and the amount of improvement that \nmight be expected was illustrated in the Navy Women\u2019s Uniform study discussed", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3847, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4a92688-16f0-4e2e-9217-292662626f25": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4a92688-16f0-4e2e-9217-292662626f25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8429a24c-3090-4210-9116-41c863077cd1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "2a454ab29767f10d11b4d70f1a4939f525c08a5f50a12f57f4021e8db433934c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "10 Product Fit and Sizing\nabove ( Mellian et al., 1991 ; Robinette et al., 1991 ). Dr. Robinette and Ms. Mellian \nwere only asked to validate the \u201cimprovement\u201d in fit with the addition of sizes. \nHowever, they did more. They did a full fit audit of the sizing. This assessed who was accommodated, who was not, and how that mapped against the target wearer population, the Navy female recruits.\nRobinette and Mellian measured each of the women (anthropometry) and recorded \ntheir demographics in addition to assessing fit. From this information, they deter -\nmined who was accommodated in the sizes, who was not accommodated, which sizes were unnecessary, and what sizes were needed that were not available. Based on the fit audit they were able to understand how to resolve the fit issues and accom -\nmodate 99% of the recruits, a huge improvement from the baseline of fitting 25% of the recruits, without increasing the number of sizes. The product of the fit audit was a new sustainable fit standard, or sizing standard, for pants and skirts.\nThis analysis revealed two things: (1) there was no sustained fit standard and  \n(2) there were two body shapes that the existing Navy sizes did not accommodate inany of the pant-and-skirt styles. We determined there was no sustainable fit standardsince the women fit in as many as four different sizes in the four pant-and-skirt styles.\nPattern analysis revealed that the sizes 10 and 11 had identical patterns. This \nwas also true for sizes 12 and 13 and similarly the size 14. When questioned, the manufacturer said that the client (the Navy) had asked for more \u201cin-between sizes\u201d to help the problem of poor fit. However, no spec, guidance, or instructions on how to create the extra sizes was provided. The manufacturer compared the size 10 and 12 patterns. The pattern alteration to create an in-between size 11 would have been so small that it was less than the sewing tolerance for each size, so they decided to exactly replicate the size 10 pattern and call it size 11. The customer (the Navy) asked no ques -\ntions and thus, the manufacturer didn\u2019t say how they added the in-between sizes. As a result, the first time this duplication came to light was during the fit audit. In summary, there were exact duplicate sizes in the size range with different size labels to fulfill their client\u2019s instructions of creating in-between sizes. Clearly, this attempted solution didn\u2019t improve the number of people who achieved a fit and instead led to both confu -\nsion and the additional cost for the client of doubling the inventory held.\nIn addition, the size 10/11 in the blue skirt was equivalent to the size 12/13 in the \nwhite skirt. For example, subject number 395 achieved her best fit in the size 11 for the white skirt, but size 13 for the blue skirt. Her best fit size was size 12 for the white pants, but size 10 for the blue pants. If we consider the duplicate sizes this becomes size 10/11 for the white skirt, size 12/13 for the blue skirt, size 12/13 for the white pants, and size 10/11 for the blue pants. The color of the item is based on the uniform of the day. They would wear a white or blue uniform but would never wear part white and part blue.

The Navy felt the women would not like sizes called plus hip or minus hip, so it was decided to call the large hip sizes \u201cwomen\u2019s\u201d sizes (W) and the smaller hip sizes \u201cjunior\u2019s\u201d (J).

The manufacturers know they are not solving the problem but simultaneously do not have the right information to effectively offer alternative solutions. Specifically, they are missing information and expertise in fitting their clients\u2019 TP and have no sustainable fit stan -\ndard to guide them. This means the manufacturer will not point out the issues and instead slavishly follow instructions to keep their clients happy and their contracts in place. These situations are completely avoided with a sustainable fit standard based on a fit audit.\nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK\nThis book is intended to be a guidebook for all product fit and sizing aspects of the wearable product design as well as a reference book for refreshing our minds about the best practices for different procedures. It is structured to help a newcomer to the fieldwork, through the whole process while also enabling experienced readers to skip around to whatever part is of interest. It is divided into two sections. The first sec -\ntion, Chapters 2 to 4 , contains instructions for carrying out the best practices. The \nsecond section, Chapters 5 to 7 , is a section with industry-specific explanations and \nexamples.\nChapter 2  is all about all the things we need to know or think about before we start \nthe SPEED process. This includes tools, materials, personnel, training, resources, and inputs like requirements and constraints. It includes things to consider before starting that we want to have or keep track of later, such as how the data will be saved and stored. We will also talk about TP sampling and the COF definition which can occur throughout the process, not just before we start. Since we might have a good sample from the TP before we start, and we should have some COF then as well, we include these discussions in Chapter 2 . However, it is often the case that a good \nsample from the TP might be gathered as we do fit testing or when we do a sizing loop fit audit, and the COF is tested and refined at least twice in the process and not just before we start.\nChapter 3  is about selecting and using cases. Cases are numeric, digital, or physi -\ncal representatives and are essential components to both design and sustainable fit standards. Numeric cases are things such as a list of body measurements in a speci -\nfication. Digital cases can be digital models or copies of people, body segments, or manikins. Physical representatives can be live models, or physical manikins or body forms. For some products, all three types are used, and it is very important that they be well selected, evaluated, and represented.\nChapter 4  contains most of the testing and analysis procedures for both the design \nand sizing loops. It has a general overview but then breaks down the experimental design and analysis by type of test, and these are organized into design loop and sizing", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3373, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbd1beb8-7eeb-45a6-a8e2-7c1285267f2c": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbd1beb8-7eeb-45a6-a8e2-7c1285267f2c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c38504cb-a6e6-4c99-a562-96b154e2cd59", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "eab15785d0bd68db3918dcfb350870513728e672b1e07e8266951fc91c4852c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "14 Product Fit and Sizing\nloop sections. This chapter explains how to do fit mapping, select the sizes, predict the \nsize of best fit, and create a tariff to estimate how many of each size to produce or stock.\nThe remaining three chapters put the process into the context of three differ -\nent industries, mass-produced apparel, head and face wearables, and footwear. Each contains a section that discusses industry-specific issues and terminology followed by a section of examples we refer to as case studies that illustrate how the process is applied in that industry.\nChapter 5  discusses mass-produced apparel because mass production has many \nopportunities to improve fit and reduce waste. It begins by describing industry practices and how they can be improved with the SPEED process. This is followed by case studies illustrating some of the ways the SPEED process is implemented. Examples include a fit audit of an existing pant, the use of 3D scanning overlays to assess fit, evaluation of body armor before purchasing, and the use of a prototype test to fix a grading issue.\nChapter 6 is focused on wearables for the head and face, such as helmets, XR \nheadsets, and head worn PPE . Small differences in people can have a large impact \non fit and performance in this area, and products often need to follow the contours of  \nthe head and face closely, therefore accommodation of head and/or face size and shape variance could be extra challenging. These products often have complex, expensive and/or time-consuming production requirements, resulting in more time spent on  \nthe initial design from digital cases, and less fit iterations. Initial fit iterations are also more often done using non-functional or representative (not final) product materials. This chapter describes the extra challenges for this region of the body with several examples illustrating how some companies used the SPEED process to overcome them.\nChapter 7  is all about footwear. The foot is perhaps the most complex body seg -\nment to accommodate in a product. Each foot has 26 bones, 33 joints, 107 ligaments, and 19 muscles. This does not even include the bones in the ankle and leg that con -\nnect to the foot. In addition, the feet support the body weight and transfer it to the ground and are important for controlling body movement with efficiency and stabil -\nity. The footwear industry also has some standard tools and practices that have been used effectively in the past so they are important to maintain. This chapter reviews the current practices and explains how the SPEED process can be used to improve upon them. Then it provides two case studies illustrating how to implement the improvements for casual and fashion footwear, and for innovative footwear products.\nWhether your interest in the subject is driven by an economic lens, optimizing the \nsafety, performance, or aesthetic of the wearable product, this book aims to provide you with the current best practices through the life cycle process. You should come away with \u201chow to\u201d knowledge of the SPEED process, which includes concepts such as defining the product inputs, selecting a case/fit model(s), drafting the COF for the product, conducting fit studies of various types, mapping the range of sizes against the TP and providing a size range among other outcomes. The examples discussed in this chapter make for a compelling motivation to apply this process effectively. We have drawn upon decades of experience, research, and applied knowledge to share with you. Regardless of your role in parts, or all of the SPEED process, we hope it will be a fascinating and satisfying experience that will help you to learn, apply, and contribute to the improved engineering, design, and evaluation of wearable products.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3776, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7548033-1f8d-4d52-af42-bf02585c5984": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7548033-1f8d-4d52-af42-bf02585c5984", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "387c149e-6fcc-421f-a1b7-38f1d8d05ca1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "473ea2fcb5b08ccf3ca06c59ade6493995bb9a5f4f14b89b41f4ea321edfc9a2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "15 Introduction\nREFERENCES\nDainoff, M., Gordon, C., Robinette, K.

Robinette\nABSTRACT\nThis chapter discusses the things to know, prepare, obtain, document, and assess \nbefore starting product design or evaluation. It serves as a checklist or a reminder with handy tips for the more experienced person and as a detailed guide for the nov -\nice. It is divided into three sections that match the inputs in the Sustainable Product Evaluation, Engineering, and Design (SPEED) process: (1) product, (2) resources, and (3) target population (TP). The product section discusses what we need to know about the product such as the product concept, how it is supposed to function, how it is expected to fit, and any constraints. The resources section discusses the tools needed, the personnel needed and their training, the facilities and test site consider -\nations, as well as planning for data collection, data management, and maintenance. The TP section discusses how to represent and characterize the TP before, during, and after data collection.\nTesting and gathering data on human subjects is a large part of the SPEED process \nenabling informed decisions throughout the process. Testing tells us what works and what does not, what is good and what is better, and what the users like and what they do not like. If we know these things early, it is less expensive to make changes than if we wait until the design is complete. If we wait until we are evaluating sizing for the finished product, it could be too late. Careful preparation allows us to avoid wasting time and money while doing this. Or as Benjamin Franklin once said, \u201cA stitch in time saves nine\u201d.\nA large part of the preparation involves minimizing, controlling, and accounting \nfor variability we do not want (error) such that with the help of probability theory and statistics, we can make good decisions. Whenever measurements are performed, no matter how carefully or scientifically it is performed or the quality of the measur -\ning instrument, measurements are always susceptible to error and uncertainty. This is true even for measuring things that don\u2019t live, breathe, and change all the time. In the Metrology and Engineering fields, this is called Measurement uncertainty. Measurement uncertainty  is an estimate of the level of accuracy and precision with \nwhich a measurement can be taken with a given tool or process.\nMeasurement uncertainty is one type of error. There are many sources of error \nincluding the tools used and their precision, the measurers and their training, environmental conditions, changes in the person being measured, measurement location, type of measurement, measurement method, clarity of measurement description, the sample size relative to the population size, and more. Unfortunately, these sources do not cancel each other out, but the error expands with each addi -\ntional source. Therefore, it is important to do things to minimize or at least manage 2\nThis chapter has been made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3031, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2435376-9abd-46a8-8edd-e879966f5078": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2435376-9abd-46a8-8edd-e879966f5078", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2896eb96-02a9-47fe-a43b-f1d3385a6d6b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "340d265a5c805fcd6d4718ed4967d3edbe14b0e8593419583f4ec39288000124", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "17 Inputs and Getting Started\nerrors from each source. This begins with good preparation, which is a large part \nof this chapter.\nPRODUCTS\nBefore we start the design and/or testing, there are two categories of things we need \nregarding the product: (1) requirements and constraints for the product and (2) the \ndesign concept including the Concept-of-Fit (COF). This includes describing the prod -\nuct, what it must do, who will use or wear it [target population (TP)], and any limita -\ntions in time, money, or other factors. As the product is tested, new requirements will \nreveal themselves and some of the pre-set requirements will change. However, through \nthe course of the design process, having clear and documented requirements, in the \nbeginning, helps track changes and understand the reasons for the changes. Poorly \ndefined or unclear product goals can also result in wasted time and money. It is much \nmore difficult to hit a fuzzy, moving target than a clear, stationary one. As Charles F. \nKettering once said, \u201cA problem well stated is a problem half-solved\u201d.\nRequIRements  anD Const RaInts\nThe best requirements have input from all the different types of stakeholders. A \nstakeholder, in this instance, is someone who has an interest or concern in the \nproduct, its fit, and its function. This can include people from senior management, \nproduct development, sales, marketing, engineering, design, legal department, and \npotential customers. Getting their input up front can avoid problems later and save \ntime getting the product to market.\nEstablished companies have probably been through the process of documenting \nand reviewing requirements for previous products. They may know their customers \nwell and have a good idea about the requirements for the new product. Therefore, \nthis step may be easy for them.\nHowever, new start-up companies seem to have difficulty with this part. They fre -\nquently create a prototype before understanding and defining the requirements and \nthe TP. It is reported that more than 90% of new start-ups fail and the number one \nreason new start-ups fail is because they built something no one wanted ( Garplid, \n2013 ). In other words, they failed to validate the product requirements with potential \ncustomers and stakeholders. This emphasizes the importance of not only clear but \nalso validated requirements. Before defining requirements, it is important to know \nwhat your customers want or need badly enough that they will spend money on it, \nand it is also important to know what is achievable for a cost that will enable the \nbusiness to make enough money to survive.\nFor example, mass-production apparel manufacturers want a product that sells \nwell, usually by making the wearer look good while allowing movement and keeping \ncosts to a minimum. This is not a product that perfectly matches the size and shape \nof the body. They also have some strong opinions about what looks good that may \nor may not conform to what their customers think looks good. Whether we agree or \ndisagree with these opinions, it is good to know something about them before we \ndefine our requirements.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3142, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3dadfae2-9d88-4c22-85e2-fe4423598c20": {"__data__": {"id_": "3dadfae2-9d88-4c22-85e2-fe4423598c20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e55be52d-dbe1-44a0-990b-c19455209f79", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "c4edd53e25acc7648c9e84818c3816b6affdb77217335dc5aa875a29b038a77b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "18 Product Fit and Sizing\nTo avoid making something that no one wants and being one of the 90% of start-\nups that fail, a good place to start is with some of the questions from the Heilmeier \ncatechism ( Heilmeier, 2021 ) and answer the following:\n\u2022 What are you trying to do?\n\u2022 How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\n\u2022 What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?\n\u2022 Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?\nTo answer these questions, we must start with a literature review or a review of \nwhat has been done before. Then to answer the remaining questions we need to \ninterview people who have done something similar and people who will care. The \nlatter are people from groups or organizations you believe will want the product. \nKim Goodwin\u2019s book on design, even though focused on software, has extensive \ndetail regarding communicating with potential customers and users and establish -\ning requirements that apply to any kind of product for human use ( Goodwin, 2009 ).\nThe purpose of interviewing is to understand needs and wants, that is, require -\nments. It is not about learning if they want your concept of a proposed product. In \nfact, it is best if only a proposed solution is mentioned, not the detail of the proposed \nproduct because this will bias their responses. The questions should be about learn -\ning what is being done now that the product will improve upon, what issues they \nare having, and what kinds of things they believe are needed. For example, imagine \nyou are planning to build a wearable, vital signs monitoring device. You may have \nin mind a vest, an arm band, or a head band, but it is best if the person being inter -\nviewed does not know your plan. Instead, tell them you are doing research on vital \nsigns monitoring and want to ask them about their experiences with it. Some of the \nquestions you might ask include following:\n\u2022 What types of devices do they use?\n\u2022 How happy are they with them?\n\u2022 What issues do they have with them?\n\u2022 If they could improve them, what would they do?\n\u2022 How close the devices need to be to a particular point on the body to give \naccurate readings?\n\u2022 If they could have any product they don\u2019t currently have, what would it be?\nIt is also important to interview other stakeholders such as the people who might \nfund the development, company managers, people from marketing departments, \npeople from purchasing department, and engineers who understand what is involved \nin producing such a product. If, for example, the product you plan to build is deemed \nby the engineers to only be possible by using very expensive components that make \nit unaffordable, it is best to find that out in the beginning, so you can try to find a \nless expensive but doable option. Interviewing possible stakeholders has an added \nbenefit.

It was developed to help new start-ups be successful. It is \nan intense several-week course established to \u201creduce the time and risk associ -\nated with translating promising ideas and technologies from the laboratory to the \nmarketplace\u201d ( National Science Foundation, 2020 ). It uses customer and indus -\ntry discovery through 100 or more interviews before deciding on the product and \nestablishing the requirements. We know from personal experience that it is com -\nmon for new start-ups to completely change their product by the end of the course \nand then they end up with a viable company for the long term. One of the key \nresources for this program is the book by Stephen Blank about having a successful \nstart-up ( Blank, 2020 ). Other countries, like Australia, have similar start-up help \nfor self-employment provided by their government ( https://whatsnext.dewr.gov.au/\ntry-something-new/starting-small-business ).\nKey performance indicators (KPIs)  are quantifiable measures of product perfor -\nmance and these serve as the list of requirements in the requirements document. They \ncan be things the product is being designed to do, such as monitoring heart rate or \nprotecting from aerosols. Or they can be things the product must be able to do while \nat the same time doing what it is designed to do, such as being comfortable and stable \nor enabling the user to reach or see something. A KPI requires some sort of metric \nthat indicates success or failure. For wearable products, some examples include the \nfollowing:\n\u2022 Ninety percent of the target users should find it acceptably comfortable after \n3 hours of wear\n\u2022 Will not shift more than 2 cm during exercise\n\u2022 Product temperature will not exceed 40 degrees\n\u2022 Lenses will not contact the eyelashes\n\u2022 Product will not impede full range of arm movement\n\u2022 No more than 10% blockage of peripheral vision\n\u2022 Must completely cover all skin without gaps when sitting or standing, or\n\u2022 Ninety percent of the target users like the way it looks\nThis last one will make some engineers scowl, but our experience has shown that \ncustomers will pay lots of money for something that they think makes them look good \neven if it is extremely uncomfortable. For example, women wear shoes with extremely \nhigh heels that not only hurt their feet but can even permanently damage them. Women \n(and some men) wore corsets that made it difficult to breathe for centuries. We had a \nrecent example where women bought two pairs of the same pant, one to wear at work \nwhere they stood up all day and one in a larger size to wear to drive home. They liked \nthe pant that looked good on them while standing but it was too uncomfortable to sit \ndown in it. This customer called the smaller size their \u201cstanding-only pant\u201d.\nIn addition, people will not buy a product, no matter how comfortable or effective, \nif they do not like the way it looks.

The changes will be guided \nby the requirements. The requirements may also change as we learn what works and what does not. By having a requirements document at the start, we can track changes and the decision process.\nThe requirements should also describe who the intended or expected wearers \nwill be. We refer to this as the TP. The TP definition will be used to guide the selection of subjects for design and testing, as well as size selection and cost/benefit analysis. A good definition of the TP is important to ensure that the prod -\nuct will accommodate the most users in the fewest number of sizes. When we get to the cost/benefit analysis, we will need a good sample drawn from the TP to make informed choices regarding which and how many of each size to produce (Robinette & Veitch, 2018 ).\nThe TP definition should describe the demographics of the expected users. The \npurpose of demographics is to ensure that the sizes and shapes of the relevant groups of people are adequately represented and to ensure that time and money are not wasted on groups who will not be users. Demographics generally include things such as gender, age group(s), and geographic user region. It might also include things specific to the product such as people with health conditions, people who participate in a particular sport, or people from an occupational group such as firefighters or software developers. People in different occupations can have very different body proportions.\nLet us consider some examples of demographics that impact size and proportions. \nIn Table 2.1 , we see the mean stature values from three countries; Italy, the United \nStates, and The Netherlands; calculated from the raw data from the CAESAR\u2122 \nTABLE 2.1\nStature Statistics from Three Countries\nDifferences (mm)\nStature (mm) Italy United States Netherlands (NL) IT-USA USA-NL IT-NL\nMales\nMean 1736 1777 1815 \u201341 \u201338 \u201379\nStd.

These were data collected by the same measuring \nteams using the same tools and methods as part of one data collection series in the \ntime frame from 1998 to 2000, so any differences are not due to measurers, tools, or \ntime frames. They reflect differences in the populations of the three countries.\nThe means from the different countries are all significantly different at \u03b1 = .01. \nAs can be seen, even though Italy and The Netherlands are both European countries, \nthe Dutch have much larger statures than the Italians, 79 mm and 69 mm difference \nfor males and females, respectively. Therefore, making a pant for the Italian popula -\ntion, it is likely to be too short for the Dutch population. The means for the United \nStates fall between the Dutch and Italian means, however, they are still significantly \ndifferent. This illustrates just how important the definition of the geographic region \nfor the user population can be.\nIn their article on firefighter anthropometry Hsiao et al. (2014)  provide us with a \ngood example of occupational differences. They estimated that \u201cOn average, male \nfirefighters were 9.8 kg heavier and female firefighters were 29 mm taller than their \ncounterparts in the general U.S. population\u201d. They further noted that \u201cThey also \nhave larger upper body builds than those of the general U.S. population\u201d. The fact \nthat male firefighters are not substantially taller than the general U.S. population, but \nthey are substantially larger in the upper body is an indication that there are propor -\ntional differences. Therefore, to get the proportioning right for firefighting apparel, \nwe should use firefighters for our design cases and fit models.\nHsiao et al. (2021)  demonstrated there are large differences between law enforce -\nment officers (LEOs) and the general U.S. population. In this article, they illustrate \nthe difference using a three-dimensional (3D) scan of a case that is near the mean \nfor male LEOs compared to a 3D scan of a case that is near the mean for the general \nmale population of the United States. This allows us to see not only the size but also \nthe shape differences.\nOnce we have a definition of our TP in our requirements document, we must \ngather samples from it or have a plan for how and when we will get one. In the design \nand sizing loops, we will represent the TP using cases and samples taken from it or \na similar population.\nDesIgn ConCept\nA design concept must clarify where on the body the product is intended to be worn, \nhow it is expected to function, how it is expected to look, any other items with which \nit must interface, and what are the expectations regarding what will constitute a fit. \nIf this is a new kind of product, it is reasonable to expect that some of these concepts \nwill change during development, but if we document our starting concept, then we \ncan track the changes along with the reasons for them. When we have a record, we \ncan keep on a steady course even with changes to the design and engineering team, \nand it permits reconsideration of design trade-offs as the product evolves.\nThe concept of what constitutes a good fit versus a poor fit and methods for assess -\ning or measuring it is referred to as the COF. It is important because it defines the pri -\norities while integrating and balancing the look, function, form, and fit. Sometimes \nfeatures like the look and comfort become trade-offs, so the COF helps prioritize \none over the other.

There are three parts to a COF:\n1. Fit requirements\n2. Tools or metrics to assess the requirements\n3. Level of acceptability or unacceptability (pass or fail)\nFit criteria will differ depending on the item being assessed and who is assess -\ning. So, the COF for a fashion item will look very different from an item of personal protective equipment (PPE). Judgment of fit depends on the assessor\u2019s point of view and priorities. The wearer judges fit on themselves, the company judges fit through the lens of the brand identity, and PPE is judged largely on its performance. The COF should consider everyone\u2019s opinion that matters.\nTable 2.2  illustrates one example of a COF for a head wearable. In this example \nthere are three fit categories: (1) location, (2) comfort, and (3) stability. There is a list of tools or metrics to be used to assess the requirements and there are pass or fail criteria for each. This example comes from early in the design process when the mock-up was not functional. It was a simple 3D printed shape with the size, shape, weight, and fitting properties of the design concept. Once a functional prototype was available, the COF changed to replace location measurements with functional assessment of the person\u2019s ability to see and use the wearable as needed. The location pass/fail criteria were approximations for the mock-up, but they were sufficient to enable the refinement of the form factor, weight distribution, size, shape, and fitting mechanisms without having to produce expensive fully functioning prototypes. This saved money and time.\nA good COF must state how the quality of the fit will be measured. This might \nbe done using a questionnaire and/or objective fit measurements such as measuring parts per million (ppm) leakage in a mask. Regardless of the method used to measure and score, the pass/fail value should not be arbitrary. In other words, do not set a pass/fail value in advance if we do not know the value in advance. Instead, have the investigator conducting the test make a pass/fail judgment.\nThis may seem like common sense but setting arbitrary pass/fail criteria is a surpris -\ningly common problem for fit testing. Engineers are particularly uncomfortable with opinions. They want a number. However, if we do not know the number, then an arbi -\ntrary number can be horribly wrong. For example, in the fit test of a flight helmet, the manufacturer had specified that the pupil of the subject had to be exactly 2 inches below the edge roll (the part of the helmet above the eyes in the front). When the fit test began, everyone failed. No one could get the helmet placed in that location. Furthermore, the pilots did not want the helmet to be placed in that location because it limited their ability to look up, a maneuver that could save their life. It was determined that the helmet fit well as it was and needed no changes. It was the pass/fail fit criteria that were wrong.\nAnother example was demonstrated by a law enforcement organization that was \ntesting a ballistic vest to determine which vest sizes to buy. They specified that the bottom of the vest should be between 0 and 1 inch above the navel to fit. When the vest was pilot-tested, few LEOs wore it that way.

When we asked the organization why they had the 1-inch \nlimitation, we were told that most vital organs were above the navel and they did not want the vest to ride up into the neck when the person sat down. Riding up was not an issue and their theory about fit was flawed. The organization\u2019s COF outcomes resulted in less coverage and poorer fit. A better COF was to allow it to rest on the utility belt and ensure it did not interfere with the neck when seated. These kinds of issues are quickly resolved with the COF mini-tests or a pilot test.TABLE 2.2\nExample Concept-of-Fit for Non-Functioning Mock-Up\nConcept \u2011of\u2011Fit for Non \u2011Functioning Mock \u2011Up of the Head Wearable\nThere are three fit categories: location, comfort, and stability. All three must simultaneously  \npass fit to be an overall pass.\nLocation Location-fit will be measured using 3D scanning and measuring the eye location and head \nhorizontal orientation with respect to the display. The process is as follows:\n1. The subject will be scanned without the wearable with the subject looking at his or herself in the mirror to establish the natural gaze plane (scan 1). Pupil landmarks will  be identified in the scan.\n2. Subject will be scanned with the head wearable in place (scan 2) and landmarks will  be identified indicating display location and orientation.\n3. The head wearable will be 3D scanned (scan 3). Landmarks will be identified in the scan indicating display location and orientation.\n4. Scan 2 will be registered to scan 1 in the software tool by matching the visible areas  of the subject\u2019s head and face.\n5. Scan 3 will be registered to scan 2 in the software tool by matching the visible areas  of the wearable.\n6. Using the software tool, measure the distances between the scan 1 pupils and the scan  \n3 display.\na. Shortest straight-line distance\nb. Distance horizontal to the display orientation\n7. Calculate the angle between the straight-line distance and the horizontal distance.\nPass criteria:\nHorizontal and straight-line distances are less than 25 mm.Angle between horizontal and shortest straight line is greater than 10 degrees.\nComfort Comfort will be assessed using an ordinal scale questionnaire instrument at two points:  \n(1) immediately after the wearable is first fitted (5 minutes) to determine if adjustments are needed and (2) after 30 minutes of wear for the final fit score. The fit fails if any one of the following conditions are true:\nSubject would not be willing to wear it for 4 hours or more.Subject scores the overall fit as poor or fail.Subject scores it a 1 for pressure in any area (not satisfied at all \u2013 pressure is very distracting).\nStability Stability will be assessed using an ordinal scale questionnaire instrument at two points:  \n(1) immediately after the wearable is first fitted (5 minutes) to determine if adjustments are needed and (2) after 30 minutes of wear for the final fit score. The fit fails if the wearable nearly fell or slipped out of position and did not return during normal wear or after roll, pitch, and yaw movements.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3121, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8c21735c-6ad2-4665-8933-2f58ff04e49a": {"__data__": {"id_": "8c21735c-6ad2-4665-8933-2f58ff04e49a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cce51eea-ffe5-4a16-b37b-3e6c5b8a27be", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "96aca7a08b26b34949718fc17281c8e2260dd2a746237a36400accce8c499c6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "24 Product Fit and Sizing\nIn these two examples, the pass/fail criteria were objective measures that did not \nrequire the subject\u2019s opinion, but they were not good measures of fit. They illustrate that \nobjective measurements are not necessarily better than subjective opinions. Objective \nmeasurements can sometimes give a false sense of confidence if the interpretation of \nthe number is based on arbitrary or theoretical pass/fail criteria. If we make the judg -\nment based upon how well the subject said he or she could perform their job or tasks, \nthen we can test our theory about fit, adjust the location, tightness or looseness, and so \non angle to match where it does fit best and can use the fit results to improve the design.\nThings to consider when drafting a COF include (1) product performance require -\nments, (2) use environment (occupation, indoor vs outdoor, etc.), and (3) integration and \ncompatibility with other things to be worn or used with it. A procedure for the construc -\ntion of fit criteria is described in detail in a fit mapping manual by Choi et al. (2009) . It \ninvolves breaking down the criteria into a list of all the requirements and measurements \nthat should be assessed. Then systematically translating that list into a consistent and \nmeasurable form by which fit can be evaluated and quantified. This can be helpful for \ncomplex items like protective gear to ensure nothing important is overlooked.\nRegardless of how careful we are when we create the COF, it is important to test \nit in a pilot test. The pilot test helps us find flaws in our scoring, reveals differences \nof opinions about fit, and helps us standardize the opinions we get from the question -\nnaire thereby minimizing the error. It also helps to educate new personnel who join \nthe team after the COF has evolved. New people may want to revert to a COF that \nhas been rejected or refined. When the COF and changes have been documented and \ntested, we have the evidence to show the new people, so we can avoid vicious circles \nand repetition of mistakes.\nRESOURCES\nAfter we have a design concept and a list of requirements and constraints, we can begin \nto identify and obtain the necessary data collection, analysis, and management tools, \nas well as the personnel and the facilities. The process of identifying and obtaining \nresources is to: (1) identify the data we need to gather, (2) evaluate the tools needed \nto gather and analyze that data, (3) down-select and obtain the appropriate tools,  \n(4) identify the skills needed to gather and analyze the data, (5) recruit or train person -\nnel to have those skills, and (6) secure the facilities needed for conducting the testing.\ntooLs\nTools are needed for data analysis and management as well as for data collection. \nWe estimate and control for some types of error using probability, statistics, and \nexperimental design. Some of the most common statistics used to estimate error \ninclude the standard error (SE), the standard deviation (STD), and the standard error \nof the mean (SEM). The smaller the error the more likely we will be to be able to find \ntrue differences between people, components, treatments, performance, or products. \nTherefore, it is important to have statistical analysis software available that will per -\nmit us to factor out the error and understand our results.\nData analysis tools must enable us to do statistical analysis, extract information from \nand/or edit 3D or four-dimensional (4D) data files and visualize product-to-subject", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3529, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1b36c4e-ec35-445a-9e22-96f4c6249ed6": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1b36c4e-ec35-445a-9e22-96f4c6249ed6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d8c70b9a-c936-40b9-b1ae-d1452d3e8200", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "25", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "38641288312c592926be3686bb5c6e04abdeb369f4cc645a56b4aafdc157243f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "25 Inputs and Getting Started\nrelationships.

This data is not a random \nsample and not intended to be used for design purposes.\nIn this book, we use SPSS\u00ae for most of the statistical analyses, plots, and graphs. This \nincludes frequency plots and graphs, chi-square analysis, correlation analysis, bivariate \ncharts, linear regression, stepwise discriminate analysis, and more. We also use SPSS to \ntailor and weight our datasets and we explain how in the TP sampling section. SPSS can \nimport and export our ExcelTM file datasets, and it has a text file which is a recording of \nwhat was done, so we can track and document the analysis. If we plan carefully, we can \nuse SPSS to re-group and re-analyze data or to combine data from multiple tests.\nOften when we start fit testing, we are not thinking about whether we will use the \ndata for future products, but these data sets are valuable resources that can be used \nagain and again. Not only will we want to compare the results from this product to \nthe next one but we will be continually adding to an anthropometry resource that can \nbe used to represent our TP in the future. Therefore, it is important to think about \nhow to save the data for future use and combine it with future data collections.\nSubject numbers are assigned to give each individual anonymity and protect their \nprivacy. They are also used to track and connect different types of data collected in a \ntest or study. When assigning subject numbers, we need to consider that the same per -\nson might be used in testing multiple times or for multiple tests. Therefore, each person \nshould be assigned a number or identifier that is used for all testing. This will avoid \ncounting some people more than once in an analysis inadvertently. Giving each person \none and only one unique number requires tracking numbers by some identifier in a \nseparate file, but it allows us to easily follow a person\u2019s progress through multiple tests.\nThe data collected for some tests might also include things that do not fit into a \nspreadsheet such as photos, videos, or 3D scans. Each subject may have this data in \nseparate files, so it is a good idea to ensure the file names indicate both the subject \nnumber and the associated test and test condition. For example, the polygonal mesh \n3D scan file for subject number 0007 in the study called \u201ccsr\u201d and in the standing \npose a was saved as \u201ccsr0007a.ply\u201d. This file name contains the study name (csr), \nthe subject ID number (0007), the pose (a), and the file format (ply). When there are \nhundreds or even thousands of photos or scans, the ability to search the filename is \nessential. It can also be helpful if there is a column or columns in the data spread -\nsheet that list the file names for any photos or scans taken.\nThe same subject should retain the same unique identifier if they are measured \nmultiple times. For example, if the subject is a fit model in the fashion industry, then \nthey might be measured once every six months to track any change in their body size \nas well as trying on multiple garments. It is important to keep track of which repeat \nis which so they can be evaluated later. This is done by creating file naming conven -\ntions. For example, the naming convention might include the following:\n\u2022 The study or test identifier, e.g., MZ\n\u2022 The subject\u2019s unique identifier or subject number, e.g., 0105\n\u2022 The date in reverse order, e.g., YYYYMMDDTTTT\n\u2022 The garment code or name, e.g., P77998\n\u2022 The size, e.g., size 8", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3628, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e69635c1-ee6b-43b9-9a0a-e14718a4f950": {"__data__": {"id_": "e69635c1-ee6b-43b9-9a0a-e14718a4f950", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e829263d-ffd3-48db-a159-1d9a1f017851", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "27", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "cbf882f57a4ccfd976ddfab8912db3a9b2f57f21549f4d98b787ec31569ad8a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "27 Inputs and Getting Started\nWith this naming convention, the name of the scan file becomes a combination \nof the names, such as MZ015520230317Bb000NA. A separate file is needed to keep \ntrack of the names and identifiers. Table 2.4  is an example of an Excel\u2122 sheet used \nto track the files.\nThe tests were described in detail in another text document. This included expla -\nnations of the coded names as well as the coded responses.\nIf we use the same variables or measurements in different studies, it is important \nto use the exact same name and exact same responses. This includes upper case, lower case, hyphens, and abbreviations. If, for example, gender is recorded as M or F or NA in one study but male, female, and NA in another we cannot merge them. M and male would be analyzed as different responses. If we call a variable Hip Circ. in one study, but Hip Circumference in another these would not be automatically merged.\nIf the variables are different, then we need to give them different names. For \nexample, if we record Comfort on a scale of 1 to 10 in one study and 1 to 5 in another, these could be merged but the analysis would be incorrect. In this situa -\ntion, we should give the variable a name that corresponds to the difference, such as Comfort10 versus Comfort5.\nUsually, companies plan to have future products and/or new iterations of the same \nproduct and they will want to compare them. This is particularly true if we want to use a sustainable sizing standard. Therefore, it is important to include a variable in each data set that indicates the version of the product tested. This might require more than one variable if there are multiple configurations and sizes for a single test iteration.\nThere should also be a document that is associated with each configuration that \ndescribes it.

If there will be upgrades or new versions of the product in the future this informa -\ntion will prove invaluable. Anything that may affect fit should be described.

Questionnaires are used for self-reported measurements, \ndemographics, subjective fit questions, and product version and/or size being tested. \nPhysical instruments are used for anthropometry, product dimensions, and objective \nfit measurements such as dexterity performance testing of gloves, leakage testing of \nprotective masks, or pupil visibility testing for eye tracking in virtual reality goggles.\nThree types of data are essential  for all fit tests: (1) one-dimensional (1D) anthro -\npometric data, (2) demographics, and (3) subject fit questions. Any measurement \nthat results in one number, such as waist circumference, stature, and weight is an 1D \nmeasurement. We need 1D data for statistical analysis of the relationships between \nbody size, demographics, and fit. Two-dimensional (2D) and 3D data are nice for \nindividual subject fit visualization, but statistical analysis tools understanding popu -\nlation fit ranges within a size using 2D or 3D data are not available.\nDemographic data should include age, gender, and ethnicity at a minimum. These \nare used to ensure the appropriate representation of all groups in the sample and the \nTP. Other data may also be essential for a product, depending on the product.\nSubjective questions about fit are essential. There are no objective measurements \nor human models that can tell us if someone is uncomfortable or able to perform tasks \nwhile wearing a product. Computer models feel no pain and can do the impossible. \nHuman subjects, such as fit models in the apparel industry, who are familiar with the \ncompany\u2019s products also contribute other valuable expert commentary. We can and \noften do take objective measurements, but they do not replace subjective assessment.\n3D scans or other visualization tools are not essential for testing, but they are \nextremely valuable and should be considered. They help us understand body shape \ndifferences as well as the interface between the person and the product when  \nwe superimpose scans with and without the product. This is particularly helpful \nwhen there are fit issues that don\u2019t seem to make sense. Visualizing body shape and  \nlocation within the product is not possible with 1D measurements. To simply visu -\nalize the relationship, the scanner does not need to be precise or accurate so some \nof the less expensive tools can suffice. However, if we want to measure the location \nof the body within the product, then we need calibrated, precise, accurate, and reli -\nable scanners as well as special software tools for superimposing the scans.\nProduct measurements are also important for at least four reasons: (1) to ensure we \nare testing the size it is supposed to be, which will identify production errors, such as \nsewing and cutting errors, (2) to document the dimensions for when we make changes \nduring the design process, (3) to identify errors in the pattern, such as base size and \ngrading errors, and (4) to have a record of what we did for future reference. The product \nmeasurements can be saved in the questionnaire, or if there is a CAD file or pattern and \nthe measurements are correct, the CAD file or pattern serves as the record.\nWe start identifying the data we need with the list of fit questions we need to answer \naccording to the COF and proposed instruments we need to answer them. These, in \nturn, suggest to us what anthropometric and demographic data are relevant. We typi -\ncally start with a long list of measurements and tools and must pare it down. More is \nnot always better. It is more difficult to find volunteers if the time they spend with us \nis longer than about an hour. This is especially true if we want them to come back for \nfurther testing or if we want to test people in multiple sizes.

Pilot testing helps us \nrefine the test procedures and practice to make the test run smoothly. Once the actual \ntesting starts, no changes must be made.\nThe process of selecting and assessing questionnaire instruments is different \nfrom selecting and assessing physical measuring instruments, so we discuss them in \ndifferent sections. Since we start our list of measurements with fit questions from the \nCOF, we begin with a discussion of how to create good questions and evaluate ques -\ntionnaires for accuracy and reliability. After the questionnaire instrument section, \nwe proceed to the anthropometric measurements and discuss how to select measure -\nments and evaluate measuring tools. This is followed by a discussion of potential \nobjective physical fit measurement tools and how to evaluate them.\nQuestionnaires\nWhile we would love to have objective ways to measure all aspects of fit or tools that \ndo not require an opinion, some very important things must be measured with a good \nset of subjective questions. For example, comfort is a subjective opinion that can -\nnot be measured objectively and requires a questionnaire. We can measure related \nthings objectively, such as the amount of pressure something exerts on the body, but \nwe cannot know how much is enough or too much unless we ask the wearer. Each \nwearer is different in many ways that we do not have the ability to measure objec -\ntively. It is not just that a person\u2019s tolerance or preference is different. There are also \nunmeasurable physical differences. For example, nerve ending distribution (the abil -\nity to detect pressure) is different depending on the location on the body and it var -\nies from person to person. Fingertips are more sensitive than the center of the palm \nand some people\u2019s fingertips have more nerve endings than others. Also, human \nshapes differ so the location of the wearable with respect to the body will also differ. \nFinally, even if we could measure the number of nerve endings on a living person, \nwe still would not know how well the signals are being transmitted to the brain. This \ncan also differ depending on the area of the body and from person to person. For fit \ntesting, subjective measures are often the most important ones.\nWhen the subjects represent potential customers, their opinions can be one of the \nmost valuable pieces of information. The fit assessment can help us with marketing as \nwell as fit and the most important fit question might be, \u201cBased on the fit, would you \nbuy this product?\u201d. So, the questionnaire used for fit assessment is very important.\nA good fit assessment questionnaire has the following properties:\n1. It contains questions for both the subject and for the investigator.\n2. It is quick and easy to score.\n3. The questions with a scale are answered with a standard numbering system.\n4. The numbering system maintains the same response order.\n5. It contains fit area questions for every aspect of fit in the COF.\n6. It has at least one overall fit score question.\n7.

We have found that a scale \nof 1 to 5 is sufficient, but sometimes our customers have insisted on other ranges such as 1 to 10. This is acceptable too, but it does not really improve the result and we usually must group the numbers into two or three categories anyway.\nNote there is no place for the subject\u2019s name, identification number, or contact \ninformation. This is required to protect their privacy. The subject number is some -\nthing we assign and if we want to use the same subject for multiple tests, we must keep a separate secured file with the name and contact information associated with the subject number.\nWhile the subject\u2019s opinion about things like comfort, appearance, personal pref -\nerence, and ease of use is essential, it is also important to have the fit test investigator record his or her opinion about the fit. The subject rating is important for understand -\ning how the subject feels, which is something the fitter cannot see. The fitter, on the other hand, is someone who knows the agreed upon COF and will give a consistent rating from one subject to the next. The fitter\u2019s rating is important for standardizing the scoring and is the most important one for analysis.\nTo quickly obtain consistent answers it is important to have a set of standardized \nresponses, such as a pull-down menu, a check box, or something to circle rather than relying on the investigator to type or write down words or comments. If the subjects or investigators must write out information or type textual answers, the information often will not get recorded, will have typos, or will be difficult to analyze. Checkable responses are standardized and automatically coded.\nStandardizing the response numbering and order for questions that have a scale \nor order (called ordinal variables) in the response will reduce the chance of making a recording error and make it easier for the data analyst to understand the answers. There are two types of ordered fit questions: one that goes in only one direction from bad to good and one that goes in two directions, bad on both ends and good in the middle. In the first type, always word the questions so the largest number is the best number. For example, \u201cwaistline at the back has no bunching or horizontal wrinkling\u201d can be scored 1\u20135 where 1 is strongly disagree and 5 is strongly agree.\nThe second type of question could also use the 1 to 5 numbering, with 1 and 2 \nbeing poor in one way and 4 and 5 being poor in another, with 3 being just right. However, it is better to use negative numbers for the too small or too short responses, positive numbers for too long or too big, and 0 being just right. For example, \u201csleeve length is correct when standing normally\u201d can be scored with \u20132 being extremely too short, \u20131 is too short, 0 is perfect, 1 is too long, and 2 is extremely too long. Having the numbering system also makes it easier for the people analyzing the data. They will know from the numbers without having to read the question.\nIn the simple form in Table 2.5 , we only have an overall fit rating, but it is often \nhelpful to capture more information about areas of fit issues. When we want to under -\nstand the sources of the problem and the part of the COF that was the source of the fit failure, we need to have questions that provide the details. To do this, questions with standardized, checkable answers are used for each issue in each area. These kinds of additional details help us understand the reasoning behind the fit scores.\nAn example of this type of fit scoring is shown in Table 2.6 .

This is important. It may seem redundant, but it makes \nthe analysis clearer, faster, and easier. Sometimes people will get a good fit in more than one size or they will not get a good fit in any size. This can be difficult to decide after the subject is gone. With this method, the decision is made while the subject is present by a trained fitter who knows what is most important. Then within a few minutes, we can have some preliminary results to show management or whomever it is who wanted the results yesterday.\nIt is important to have a space for comments for two reasons: (1) issues arise that \nwere not anticipated and (2) subjects sometimes want to make comments and will give better responses if we have a space devoted to listening to them. Sometimes they can have issues that are unrelated to the study and if they do not feel we are listening it can affect their responses.\nTable 2.5  includes two comments sections, one for the subject\u2019s comments and one \nfor the investigator or fitter. However, while important, comments should be optional because a comment section cannot be relied upon to identify consistent fit issues.\nIt is important to design the fit questionnaire, so we do not lead the subject to an \nanswer or introduce bias in some way. Choi and Pak (2005)  have a nice summary of \npotential issues in questionnaires. Some common ones for fit measurement are seen in Table 2.7 .\nWhether we decide (or have an opinion) about what constitutes a good perfor -\nmance or test score before or after the testing, it is best to record the actual score and not just the decision about the quality of the fit performance. It is sometimes tempting to only record if it passes or fails the performance test, but that limits our ability to re-evaluate later. Perhaps in the future, we might have a different purpose for the product for which the score requirement is higher or lower. If we have the score, we can adjust for that. In other words, we might measure the offset or product positioning but not decide what positioning or size is best until analyzing all the data, particularly the subjective questionnaire scores.TABLE 2.6\nExample of Area Fit Scores Question\nRate the Armor  \nFit in These Areas Subject\u2019s Rating Investigator Rating\nCircs. \u20132 = Very small to +2 = Very large \u20132 = Very small to +2 = Very large\nChest \u20132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u20131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+2 \u20132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u20131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+2\nWaist \u20132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u20131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+2 \u20132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u20131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+2\nNeck \u20132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u20131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+2 \u20132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u20131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+2\nArmholes \u20132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u20131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+2 \u20132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u20131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+2\nLength \u20132 = Very short to +2 = Very long \u20132 = Very short to +2 = Very long\nTorso \u20132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u20131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+2 \u20132\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u20131\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0+2", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3309, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91d24940-c9a8-41f3-8941-a1f2fd3f0ff8": {"__data__": {"id_": "91d24940-c9a8-41f3-8941-a1f2fd3f0ff8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "01705470-b13a-4264-8525-678a6b172415", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "5d506e85065ad863e1b1967e9302a4f8f5fc41d0028dca335e37e872e3706666", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "33 Inputs and Getting Started\nIn the past, questionnaires were first recorded on paper and then entered into \nelectronic spreadsheets later. Now there are numerous tools available to collect \ndata and automatically save it as a spreadsheet for analysis. Some common ones \nare Microsoft Forms\u00ae, Google Forms\u00ae, and Qualtrics XM\u00ae. The questionnaire can \nbe accessed anywhere and data entry can occur on a tablet or laptop and the data \nautomatically collated into a spreadsheet file. It is also possible to create a ques -\ntionnaire and send it out for response via email. This can be useful for follow-up \nquestionnaires once the product is on the market or for a pre-test survey to find \npotential subjects.\nRegardless of whether the forms are paper, electronic, or on-line, it is important \nto record the exact wording of the questions and the definitions of the responses \nbefore starting data collection. This record should be saved with the questionnaire \nresponses for reference. Otherwise, we can end up with questions for which a number \nis the response, but we won\u2019t know what the number means. Is the number 1 a good \nscore or a bad score? Also, the questions in the saved spreadsheet typically have \nabbreviated names and it can be difficult to remember what the original question \nwas, especially several weeks after data collection is complete. This record should \ninclude a copy of the blank questionnaire or at least the order of the questions in the \nquestionnaire to help in the analysis.\nIt is a good idea if the questionnaire and the definition of the responses are \nrecorded as part of the COF, along with any photos or videos that help explain the \nagreed upon responses. This helps reduce debate after the testing and is useful for \nfuture reference for new items or testing.\nDemographic questions are used in the analysis in three ways: (1) to identify fit \nissues specific to one group, (2) to weight the sample to make it more representative \nof the TP, and (3) to verify that all groups within the TP will be accommodated. Age, \ngender, and ethnicity are the most common demographic questions as we know there \nare body size and shape differences associated with these different groups.\nSome demographics help identify fit issues but are not typically used to character -\nize a TP. These include experience with similar products, handedness, garment sizes \nworn, hair length and coarseness (for head wearables), beard growth (for oxygen \nmasks), fitness level, and health status. It is important to have enough detail about \neach subject to be able to understand fit issues or preferences during fit testing and \nensure all groups are accommodated.TABLE 2.7\nCommon Issues and Solutions in Drafting Fit Questionnaires\nIssue Alternative\nUse of vague words like regularly or occasionally More specific wording such as twice a week, etc.\nLeading questions such as \u201cAre you  \nuncomfortable?\u201dRate your comfort on a scale from very \nuncomfortable to very comfortable\nChanging scale, such as 1 to 10 has 10 as best for \none question but worst for anotherUse the same scale (e.g., 1 to 5) and always have \nthe order the same\nResponse fatigue from questionnaire that is too long Minimize the questions as much as possible", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3235, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29956f80-02db-4d64-a600-f2b28e8f04e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "29956f80-02db-4d64-a600-f2b28e8f04e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "841e4fc3-b25a-4203-9221-e41184045dd5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "9776aad20a5544d5cb4df2bea0477d6f5a9b292befc7ffcc2a51bf0594f951b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "34 Product Fit and Sizing\nExperience can be very important for the quality of the subjective feedback. For \nexample, if the wearable is to be worn like a helmet, someone who had experi -\nence wearing helmets is likely to be able to provide a more reasonable comfort and \nuseability assessment. They understand that some discomfort is to be expected and some tightness can reduce annoying slippage.\nIn experimental design and analysis, categories of groups that we wish to ver -\nify are adequately accommodated are referred to as blocks. For example, if we are designing a wearable to be worn by both men and women, the gender variable would be treated as a block variable. In the analysis, we would determine if fit outcome dif -\nfered depending upon gender. If so, we would look at the outcome for each gender separately to see which outcome is better and to understand why.\nThe race or ethnicity question is not clear-cut and can be sensitive. We ask these \nquestions so we can be sure that we have adequate representation from the categories to ensure all groups will be adequately accommodated. Different racial or ethnic groups can have very different shapes and proportions so accommodating one may not accommodate the others.\nWhich category to place someone is sometimes unclear. Many people have mixed \nancestry, for example, and might fall into multiple groups. In those instances, it is useful to select whatever group seems to be predominant in terms of shape or body proportions. The purpose of the grouping is to ensure that all shapes and proportions are equally accommodated; hence, this is used to select the group. If this is difficult to decide, it is important to allow them to answer \u201cother\u201d, \u201cnot sure\u201d, or \u201cdon\u2019t wish to answer\u201d. However, it is best to have few subjects in these undetermined categories. If we cannot verify that, we have sufficient representation in each group, then minority groups can end up being under-represented which can result in poorer fit for minorities.\nIt is also not  helpful to have many groups with all kinds of combinations of eth -\nnicity, such as Asian-Black-Hispanic or Indian-Black-Pacific Islander. Having doz -\nens of categories is essentially putting off the decision about groupings until after the subject is gone when it is harder, if not impossible, to decide. This can be equivalent to having no groupings at all. If we cannot decide which group predominates for an individual, we place them in the \u201cother\u201d category.\nHispanic is a question best asked separately from ethnicity in the United States. \nMany Hispanics who were born in Caribbean countries have African ancestry. Hispanics from Mexico and Central America often have Native American ancestry. Hispanics from Spain usually have white European ancestry. These groups have very different sizes and shapes. If we ask if they are Hispanic separately from ethnicity, we can better capture the differences and ensure we get good representation for everyone.\nIf our TP has people from a wide geographic region, it is important to sample from \nthroughout the region and to record their birthplace. This can be ascertained with one question or multiple questions such as country of birth and state or province born.\nMultinational studies may need to account for differences between countries. Not \nonly do we need to consider language differences but also sometimes the responses need to be different as well. For example, in the CAESAR study ( Blackwell et al., \n2002 ), the question about jacket size had different sizes in the United States than in \nItaly, because the size numbering systems were different as shown in Table 2.8 .

This enables us to determine where and how much to modify our product to fit the most people in the fewest number of sizes. Once we have our list of fit questions, we can start to list relevant anthropo -\nmetric measurements we want to consider collecting. We typically start with a long list of measurements and tools and must pare it down.\nWhen choosing anthropometric measurements and measurement tools, the three \nmost important criteria are (1) relevance to the product fit, (2) measurement quality, and (3) comparability to measurements from prior databases of TP. Just like any good science project, we begin this by reviewing what others have done. The prior studies give us ideas about what is possible with the different tools.\nPeople all over the world have been collecting and storing anthropometric data \nfor decades and there are quite a few documents describing how they took their measurements and which tools they used. Some of these documents, such as the Anthropometry of Air Force Women ( Clauser et al., 1972 ), the 1977 survey of U.S. \nArmy Women ( Laubach et al., 1977 ), and the CAESAR, Final Report, Volume II: \nDescriptions ( Blackwell et al., 2002 ) are freely available for download from the \nDefense Technical Information Center (DTIC) website ( https://discover.dtic.mil ).\nLaBat and Ryan (2019)  have a nice list of 1D anthropometric measurements for \ndifferent body areas and the WEAR Association has a collection of more than 65 datasets available for free to members ( www.bodysizeshape.com ). These are helpful \nplaces to start.\nThe International Standards Organization (ISO) has documents available for pur -\nchase such as the ISO standard 7250 contains measurement descriptions for standard measurements for international surveys to enable comparisons between datasets ( ISO \n7250-1:2017, 2017 ), and the standard for 3D scanning methodologies (ISO 20685-1, \n2018). The International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) has a measurement manual that may be purchased and offers training in taking mea-surements pertaining to sports science.\nIt is helpful to take some measurements the way others have in previous studies \nwhen we want to compare our data to them or if we want to use one of the previous TABLE 2.8\nSame Question for Men in Two Different Countries\nQuestion in the United States: What is your most common jacket size?\n30 or smaller 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 or larger\nDo not know No response\nQuestion in Italy: What is your most common jacket size?46 or smaller 48 50 52 54 56 58 or larger\nDo not know No response", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2847, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5ea3355a-0afa-4ec7-a078-9e370e70b777": {"__data__": {"id_": "5ea3355a-0afa-4ec7-a078-9e370e70b777", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5c1b9194-c00d-464f-8d2a-e23ef60c629d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "6dd2e33605e7e8e4f2a3df555d33cac2619174ab0c5b4144c7e8c29e65db2059", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "36 Product Fit and Sizing\ndata sets as a starting TP. However, we should not limit ourselves to those measure -\nments and tools. Those studies most likely had goals that were not related to our \nproduct, so they cannot be expected to always take the best measurements related \nto our product. For example, many studies that are interested in health, body com -\nposition, or kinematics take the waist measurements in a horizontal plane located at \nOmphalion (the belly button), which is perfectly reasonable for those applications. \nHowever, the waist of our clothes does not sit at Omphalion and is not a horizontal \nmeasurement. If the waist where the product will be worn is the most relevant, we \nshould take the more relevant measurement.\nThings to look for in the measurement descriptions include (1) the tool used, (2) the \nposture or pose of the subject, (3) the positioning of the tool, and (4) the direction of \nthe measurement. For example. in the 1968 survey of United States Air Force (USAF) \nwomen ( Clauser et al., 1972 ), the posture for the Sitting Height measurement was, \n\u201cSubject sits erect, head in the Frankfurt plan, upper arms hanging relaxed, forearm \nand hands extended horizontally\u201d. The tool used was an anthropometer. The position -\ning of the tool was \u201cfirmly touching the scalp\u201d and \u201cfrom the sitting surface to the top \nof the head\u201d. The direction was vertical. Photos are also helpful.\nIf we take our measurement with a different pose, tool, positioning, or direction it can \nresult in different measurement values, making them seem larger or smaller when they \nare not. One common example is when we use 3D scanners to take a 1D measurement \nversus using a manual tool such as a tape measure or a caliper. These different tools can \nresult in very different values simply because of the tool used. Manual tools touch the \nbody introducing some compression that influences the measurement values, whereas \nscanners do not. Tape measures span some of the peaks and valleys along the way but \nscanners may not or may not in exactly the same way. Therefore, even if both types of \nmeasurements are good quality measurements, it does not mean they are the same.\nAn example of the effect of posture or positioning was described in the 1968 \nUSAF study mentioned earlier. In addition to the Sitting Height with the subject sit -\nting erectly, they also took a Sitting Height measurement they called Sitting Height, \nRelaxed. There are slight differences in the postures for these two measurements, \nbecause the subject sat relaxed rather than erect, and the result was a 13 mm differ -\nence in the average values for the two.\nOnce we have an idea of what measurements we want to capture; we must con -\nsider the tools to use to capture them. Most anthropometric tools can be classified as \none of two types: (1) manual and (2) imaging. Manual tools are tools used to measure \nthe subject directly.

Imaging tool examples include the following:\n\u2022 2D imaging\n\u2022 Overlaid photographs\n\u2022 Photographs with grids\n\u2022 3D imaging\n\u2022 Stereophotogrammetry\n\u2022 Whole body scanners\n\u2022 Head scanners\n\u2022 Face scanners\n\u2022 Foot scanners\n\u2022 Hand-held scanner\n\u2022 4D imaging (3D + time)\n\u2022 Motion tracking of landmarks\n\u2022 Whole body scanners with motion frames\n\u2022 Face scanners with motion frames\n2D imaging, or use of 2D photographs, was used before we had 3D imaging. It is \nnot very accurate for measuring but can be a quick and inexpensive way to visualize \nthe product on the subject. Two photos are taken and overlaid in a software tool such \nas PowerPoint\u2122 with one image made mostly transparent. However, these overlays \nare very crude and it can be difficult to see or measure the relationship. 3D imaging \nis better for visualizing the interface. Visualizing and measuring the interface is \naddressed in the physical fit measurement section.\nStereophotogrammetry tools capture pairs of images from cameras that are in \nknown, calibrated locations with respect to each other and stereo viewers to identify \npoints on the surface of the body. Prior to the 1990s and the advent of 3D scanning tech -\nnology, this was used to get body segment volumes and 3D landmarks for estimating \nhuman biomechanics before the advent of 3D body ( Herron et al., 1976 ; McConville \net al., 1980 ). While 3D scanners offer a faster and more accurate technology for cap -\nturing the body surface, these early studies defined landmarks and body segmentation \nmethods that are essential for measurement extraction and human modeling today.\nWhen we refer to 4D scanning, we mean 3D scanning with time added or full \nbody scans in motion. This is different from motion tracking, which tracks a limited \nset of landmarks over time rather than the body surface. Motion tracking might be \nused as a physical fit assessment method or a performance assessment method, but it \nis not used for body measurement itself. Therefore, it will be discussed in the physi -\ncal fit measurement section.\nWe select tools for the data collection by evaluating and comparing them for:\n\u2022 Tool quality\n\u2022 Data quality\n\u2022 Personnel and software requirements\n\u2022 Time to results\n\u2022 Cost", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2437, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "078748fe-a75c-40fb-8d39-dac90bd24d3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "078748fe-a75c-40fb-8d39-dac90bd24d3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9d3905a6-1ce4-437e-96de-700bb55b1894", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "38", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "6144a06202d9328e6ce6526d3b112d918cbed4fefea9149bae659a6aec6aeec6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "38 Product Fit and Sizing\nTool and data quality must be assessed for each measurement to be taken. Some \ntools are best for one type of measurement but not for others.\nGood quality tools are those with a high enough resolution for the measurement \nand the ability to stay calibrated. Resolution is the closeness of the settings, grada -\ntions, or points. When gradations or points are close together it is called high resolu -\ntion and when they are far apart, they are called low resolution. If, for example, the \nclosest tick marks on one instrument are 1 mm apart, it is said to have a 1 mm reso -\nlution. An instrument that has tick marks every 0.1 mm would be considered higher resolution. Some measurements require higher resolution than others.\nCalibration is the process of determining, checking, or rectifying the settings or \ngradations on a measuring instrument or other piece of precision equipment. The tools we select must be able to be calibrated, maintain calibration for the entire test or study, and be calibrated for all sizes and shapes of subjects. Some tools deteriorate or get damaged, so we need to be able to ensure they are working properly throughout data collection. For example, a scale for measuring weight (body mass) should be checked to ensure it is outputting values that are accurate by placing objects of known weight on the scale. If it is out of calibration, it means it is outputting the wrong number. A good instrument should be able to be adjusted to ensure it provides the correct values for the full range of subjects or objects to be measured. Some instruments may be precise and correctly calibrated within a range of sizes but not be outside that range. For example, 3D scanners can have a scanning area that is precise and calibrated but outside that area, they can be imprecise or difficult to keep calibrated. This happens when a scan -\nner is designed for a standing posture with the arms at the sides but intended to be used for a seated posture or with arms akimbo. Also, sometimes the scanners are calibrated with a small- or medium-sized manikin and the point cloud is dense enough, but for a large person the points can be spread too thin. Other tools have issues as well. A scale for measuring weight may only be calibrated to 400 lb or 180 kg. So, it won\u2019t be suf -\nficient for measuring morbidly obese people. A tape measure may not be long enough for measuring things such as Vertical Trunk Circumference. These are things that must be checked before an instrument is selected for use in a study. A good instrument should also stay calibrated for at least a full day.\nGood quality data is precise, accurate, and reliable. Precision is the consistency of \nmeasurement. Accuracy is the ability of the tool to capture the true measurement we are trying to capture. Reliability is the ability to get the same measurement on live subjects under consistent conditions. Reliability is affected by precision and accu -\nracy of the tools but is also affected by the fact that we are measuring people who are constantly changing.\nThe difference between precision and accuracy is illustrated in Figure 2.1 . In Part \na of this figure, we see three measurement values that are the same, but they are not the true value. These are precise but not accurate. This can happen if a tool is not assembled correctly or if the starting point or end point for the tool is different than the starting point or end point of the measurement. For example, an anthropometer\u2019s end point for a measurement is the bottom of the tool\u2019s arm, but when we measure \u201cElbow Height, Sitting\u201d we want the measurement to the top of the tool\u2019s arm. The arm is 10 mm thick so the measurement reading on the anthropometer will be con -\nsistently off by 10 mm.

These are accu -\nrate on average but are not precise. In Part c, we see three values that are both precise \nand accurate. This is our goal.\nTool and data quality are assessed and compared by first using fixed static objects \nof known size before we then assess them on live subjects. People change constantly so the assessment with static objects gives us an idea about how good a measurement we can get if we don\u2019t have something that is breathing and moving. The objects used to assess the precision of an instrument must also reflect the size complexity of the body or body areas to be measured with it because the precision can be different for different sizes and shapes.\nPrecision can be limited by the resolution of the tool. Some 3D scanners, such as \nthe scanner used in the CAESAR project ( Robinette et al., 2002 ) have a resolution \nof 3\u20135 mm. If we need a precision of 1 mm or less, for facial measurements, for example, a 3\u20135 mm resolution would not provide measurements precise enough for our purposes. Also, each time a scan is done, the points that are collected can fall in different places on the body, so measurement precision for specific landmarks can be further degraded.\nSome aspects of accuracy can be assessed using static objects but many of the \nthings that affect accuracy cannot be effectively separated from other things that affect reliability of the measurements. Therefore, accuracy and reliability are usually evaluated at the same time on live subjects. For example, if we do not have any way to know what the \u201ctrue\u201d anthropometric measurement is on a live subject, we cannot evaluate accuracy separately from reliability.\nReliability is affected by all sources of measurement error including resolution, \ncalibration, precision, and accuracy.

They can be affected by instrument \nor measurement positioning, the visibility of landmarks, and the quality of algo -\nrithms for landmark detection and measurement extraction. It can also be affected by post processing. This is particularly an issue for 3D scan tools which may require a transformation of the data into a format that changes the body surface such that measurements may no longer be accurate.\nReliability is also affected by the measurer or observer whether that measurer is \nhuman or an artificial intelligence (AI) software tool. Human measurer\u2019s skill level, training, alertness, and attention to detail can affect measurement reliability. This can vary depending upon the training of the measurers, so reliability assessment is done when the human measurers are trained. Training is discussed in further detail in the personnel and facilities section.\nFor imaging tools with AI software, reliability includes the skill level of the software \ntools and the effect of subject positioning in the image or scan. Many 1D measurements and 3D landmarks are difficult for an AI tool to properly or consistently locate on live people which results in the inability to get the same measurement value each time a person is measured. For example, it can be particularly problematic to locate landmarks for larger people whose body surface is far away from underlying bony landmarks or who may have more complex surface shape due to fat folds. It can also be difficult to find landmarks reliably using AI on people who have lots of dark hair that does not scan well or who have extreme asymmetry. The mis-identification of landmarks can result in a biased sample as well as an unreliable one. This assessment should be done before deciding what tools to use and it is included in the imaging tool assessment section.\nA tool can be very precise, accurate, and reliable for some measurements but \nnot reliable for others. We have had 3D scanning tools for measuring the head and face since the mid-1980s ( Blackwell & Robinette, 1993 ; Robinette, 1986 ) and we \nhave had whole body scanners since the 1990s ( Robinette et al., 1999 ). Scanners are \nvaluable because they provide information that we cannot get from manual measure -\nments, particularly fit visualization. However, they are inadequate and inaccurate when used to extract or derive many 1D measurements. Each measurement should be tested to see if they are the same when using different tools, that is, a scanner versus a tape measure (ISO 20685). An ISO standard for 3D anthropometry indicates that not all measurements in the ISO basic body measurement standard 7250 ( ISO 7250-\n1:2017, 2017 ) are \u201c\u2026well-suited to extraction from 3-D scanned images\u201d.\nIn Table 2.9 , we give some examples of measurements for which scanners are \npoor tools and some for which they are the best tools. Measurements that have areas hidden from view, such as Chest Girth at Scye and Crotch Length, are best taken with manual tools. Measurements obscured by hair such as Head Breadth are also best taken with manual tools. It can also be easier to measure many different poses rapidly with manual tools. On the other hand, 3D scans capture the shape as well as the size, so they are better for shape comparison, for comparing subjects with and without the product in place, and can be better than 1D for 3D modeling. If there is a need for a physical or digital copy of an individual, processed 3D scans can be entered into a computer software tool for designing or 3D printing.\nIt is essential that some of the measurements we capture are 1D for a range of fit \nanalysis and statistical comparison of prototypes and components.

These tools are inexpensive and our customers or users are likely to have these tools as well, making them suitable for size selection.\nIt is also helpful if at least some of the 1D measurements use the same tools and \nmethods as previous studies, particularly those we want to use for representing our TP, so we can compare our subjects to theirs. 1D measurements extracted from 3D scans can be acceptable (provided they meet the measurement quality criteria), but they are not the same as measurements taken with calipers and tape measures so making comparisons to previous studies is compromised.\nSome of the pros and cons of manual versus 3D imaging tools are shown in \nTable 2.10 .

Imaging tool outputs are not standardized, so assessment methods can be different for each tool. In addition, when the data is modeled or translated to a new format, the data can be changed. If we plan to use these formats, we need to assess them as well. Therefore, we explain how to assess manual tools separately from imaging tools.\nManual Tool Assessment\nThe resolution of manual tools is easy to determine. It is simply the spread of the \ntick marks on the tool or the spread of the 2D grid lines. It is usually best to use met -\nric tools with resolutions in millimeters, centimeters, or even tenths of millimeters rather than tools with English units such as inches or fractions of inches. Metric tools are easier to record correctly since the data must be in decimals to analyze.\nManual tools are calibrated and assessed for precision using gauges and weights. \nThe weights are used for calibrating scales.

For example, if the instrument is \nmade of cloth, like some tape measures, it could stretch over time taking it out of calibration. Narrow metal ones, such as the one shown in Figure 2.3 , get the most \nreliable measurements, since they do not stretch much over time like a cloth tape and being thin (this one is 6 mm in width), they fit into smaller spaces than wider tapes.

It may be accurate for diameters but is not accurate for circumfer -\nences. Unless you want a diameter from a circumference, this side should not be used.  \nIt illustrates another reason for checking the calibration. Sometimes, the instrument \nis not measuring what we think it is.\nIt is important not to drop an instrument which can bend or knock it out of cali -\nbration. As explained in the Army measurer\u2019s handbook ( Hotzman et al., 2011 ), if an \ninstrument is dropped, a gauge should be used to check its accuracy before using it again. They also caution us not to lean an anthropometer up against a wall or table because it can easily fall and be damaged.\nMost anthropometers are multi-tools that can be configured into spreading calipers. \nOne example is shown in Figure 2.4 . The anthropometer comes in pieces that can \nbe assembled to measure heights from a seated or standing surface or configured to measure breadths and depths. The portion of the tool must be assembled correctly and read on the correct side to give the correct reading for each type of measure -\nment. The heights configuration, such as the one used for the measurement shown, indicates the measurement to the bottom of the bar. The other side indicates the measurement to the top (or the inside) of the bar for the caliper breadth reading. It is important to check the calibration each time instruments are assembled to avoid getting this mixed up.\nAccuracy and reliability using manual tools are done by repeatedly measuring \nlive subjects. This should be done by a skilled and trained measurer. An unskilled measurer will add variability to the measurements that are due to the lack of skill rather than the tool. Luckily, repeated measuring for many of the common manual tools has been done by others. We can review what they have done when evaluat -\ning what tools to use ( Gordon & Bradtmiller, 1992 ; Gordon et al., 1989 ; Hotzman \net al., 2011 ).

If we plan to use a dif -\nferent tool or take a different measurement, we should follow the same procedure to \nassess them as these authors used.\nImaging Tools Assessment\nAssessing imaging tools for quality is more complex. There are two categories of \nassessment for imaging tools: (1) assessment for visualization and (2) assessment \nfor measurement extraction. Sometimes, we only want an imaging tool for visual -\nizing shapes and relationships between products and the body. This can be extremely \nvaluable for understanding fit, but it is essentially a subjective fit assessment tool and \nany results recorded might be part of the subjective fit questionnaire. If we are only \nusing the scans to visualize the fit, we might not need dimensional accuracy, so we \ncan make do with an uncalibrated inexpensive hand-held scanner and with mini -\nmal file format translation, we can visualize using free or inexpensive tools, such as \nBlender\u2122 or even superimposed 2D photographs. Quality assessment needs only be \na check to verify that we can see what we need in the images. This might require an \nevaluation of the resolution in the images but not an evaluation of calibration, preci -\nsion, accuracy, or reliability.\nIf, on the other hand, we plan to use numerical data produced from imaging, we \nneed to first understand how the tool works, what data is being produced, how it is \nproduced, and how it is processed. Because imaging tools also require specialized \nsoftware, we must also assess the quality of the software and the ability to use the \ndata in the software tools we are using for designing and producing our products. \nIn other words, does the data import work in our CAD modeling or 3D printing and \nmanufacturing tools? The best data in the world is worthless if we cannot use it.\nThese procedures can be explained by explaining the assessment of 3D body \nscanning tools. 3D body scanning technologies obtain a set of 3D points on the sur -\nface of the body that is referred to as the point cloud . This point cloud is not a surface \nand the points in it are not connected to each other. The points are spread across the \nsurface and the distance of the spread is called the resolution. Unlike manual tools \nthat have a single resolution that does not vary, the resolution for 3D scanners varies \nfrom scanner to scanner, from person to person, from scan to scan, and can be dif -\nferent in different areas of the body. Therefore, it is much more complex to evaluate.\nLarger people have point clouds with more points in them than smaller people \nand the location of the points in the point cloud is different every time a person is \nscanned. In other words, the first point in one scan is not in the same place as the \nfirst point in another scan. To relate one scan to another, we need some identifiable  \npoints that are the same in every scan. We call these landmarks. We use named \nlandmarks that can be seen in a scan to help us orient the points in the scan and \nrelate one scan to the next. If a landmark is not clear without marking the body, we \nadd markers on the body to make it visible. This requires that the markers are vis -\nible in the software tool we plan to use to view the scans, and we need software to \ndetermine the 3D coordinates of the landmarks. The resolution of the scanned points \naffects the precision and accuracy of the landmark location because there may not \nbe a scanned point at the precise location of the landmark. Also, the scanned points \nchange every time someone is scanned, so the point that is closest to the landmark \ncan change from scan to scan.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3702, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b52ab4c-9c56-4201-94aa-0b041d9abeaa": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b52ab4c-9c56-4201-94aa-0b041d9abeaa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9bdee937-b19a-42c2-ab2b-4da1acd77332", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "c016a449cb2117e2343e67147478b99efe501bf02631fd94bea536b53a2e60fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "46 Product Fit and Sizing\nRobinette and Daanen evaluated the precision and reliability of extracting land -\nmark locations and measurements from the landmarks for two different scanners \nwhen the landmarks are marked before scanning and visible in the scans for identi -\nfication ( Robinette & Daanen, 2006 ). They scanned each subject three times in each \nscanner and evaluated the differences between 1D measurements calculated as dis -\ntances between landmarks. The measurement repeatability (reliability) was within the range of repeatability with manual tools. The reliability results for the two scan -\nners were similar but one was slightly better than the other.\nRobinette and Daanen evaluated only measurements that were the shortest dis -\ntances between two points because these types of measurements are invariant to the point of view and the axis system used. These are calculated using all three coor -\ndinates (x, y, and z) for both points. This is different from calculating a difference between two points in one direction such as Glabella to Pupil in the fore-aft direction only. It is also different than treating each individual coordinate for a landmark as a separate variable, which is how they appear in a data spreadsheet. In general, single \ncoordinates for landmarks should  not be used as independent variables . They are \nsubject to point of view or orientation error. There is no standardizable axis system that can make the individual coordinates or directions such as up, down, back, or front comparable from one person to the next.\nThis issue is illustrated in Figure 2.5 . This shows three head orientations and the \neffect it has on the distance in the Z direction (fore-aft) measurement Glabella-z to Rhinion-z. This is the same person in all three places. The head is simply rotated. The landmarks have not moved with respect to each other and the distance between the landmarks as calculated with all three coordinates has not changed. However, the values for the z distances are quite different, all due to orientation uncertainty or point-of-view error.\nFIGURE 2.5  Point-of-view error illustration.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2137, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9caee349-aebd-4026-84b2-0c825013fb51": {"__data__": {"id_": "9caee349-aebd-4026-84b2-0c825013fb51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3dc205a1-4996-4f29-b6a0-eab8b21f0ae7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "c1d5baaca5b83ffd103eae9b55d3488de3aab31d622bcfea36b57c7d10747fc9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "47 Inputs and Getting Started\nThese types of measurements are particularly a problem for the head and face for \nthree reasons: (1) head and face measurements are small, so small accuracy errors \nhave a large impact, (2) there are few reliable landmarks on the top and back of the head for orienting the point of view or axis system, and (3) the head is roughly a sphere that can be rotated multiple ways with landmarks that vary independently of each other. As a result, the inaccuracies introduced by orientation are larger than the differences between people, which means the measurements are unreliable, or worse, misleading if they are used. If measurement errors are large compared with the true differences, then the differences observed between two subjects could be due purely to error rather than to a genuine difference.\nWhitestone and Robinette (1997)  review the many ways people have tried orient -\ning the head in a standard way so that the 1D measurements could be used. None of the orientations provide accurate or reliable 1D measurements. There is one excep -\ntion to this for product design purposes. That is if the axis system and orientation are defined by the product when the actual subject is scanned in the product and both the subject landmarks and the product landmarks are visible in the same scan. This is not the same as placing a CAD model of the subject in a CAD model of the product, because the CAD model placement is hypothetical, not real, and can be subject to point-of-view or placement error.\nAnother important issue with using single coordinates from 3D landmarks has to \ndo with correlation. Since all landmarks move together, all the z distances change together which means they are correlated. The fact that they are correlated can give the impression that the distances are important. However, it merely indicates that there is a substantial point-of-view error. This topic is discussed in further detail in Chapter 6.\nThis is particularly a problem for principal component analysis (PCA) of head \nmeasurements because these correlated errors can overwhelm any other true cor -\nrelations between measurements and make the results meaningless. It may look like a component is a face depth or the eye depth component but really it is just indicat -\ning that the depth errors all vary together. When the head is rotated up, they all get smaller and when the head is rotated down, they all get larger. More information about PCA analysis and this issue is provided in Chapter 3 .\nWhen evaluating 3D scanners for resolution, calibration, and precision, it is nec -\nessary to evaluate both the hardware and the software components. The scanners Robinette and Daanen used had been assessed for resolution, calibration, and preci -\nsion using the same calibration and precision gauges and both had been calibrated prior to scanning. These assessments revealed they had similar point resolutions, but they had differences in precision and in what parts of the body surface were missing from the scan. To get a full 360-degree scan of a person, multiple scan heads that can view all around the body simultaneously are required. These scanners used similar scan heads and technology, but they used different software tools to process and combine images from the different scan heads.\nCalibration gauges for 3D scanning are more complex than for manual instru -\nments. They require calibrating in multiple directions, for different shapes, for point precision, and point resolution throughout the complex surface.

The width of the largest part is approximately the width of the largest subject expected.

It may be necessary to con -\nstruct a different calibration object and process depending on the product, the mea-surements of interest, the type of scanner, and the target market. The CAESAR\u2122 project was the first large scale 3D scanning survey and the calibration process was developed along with the data collection protocol.\nIn the ISO standard on 3D scanning methodologies (ISO 20685-1, 2018), the cali -\nbration gauge is called the \u201ctest object\u201d. There is no guidance about the test object other than it should have known dimensions and be similar to dimensions found in humans, much like the gauge used for the CAESAR\u2122 project.\nThe best scanners have a calibration system and process provided by the manu -\nfacturer. Whether one is provided or not, it is good to have a calibration process that can be checked periodically. Just like with manual tools, things can happen that can knock it out of calibration. If that happens, all measurements taken from it can be affected.\nBecause the scanners employ light that bounces off the surface and triangulation \nto find the surface, the point clouds have missing information where the surfaces are hidden (e.g., under the armpits and at the crotch), and large breaks in the data where surfaces are horizontal to the cameras used to capture the light. These miss -\ning areas are called occluded areas and some typical ones are shown in Figure 2.7 . \nFIGURE 2.6  3D scanner calibration gauge.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1840, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5de03f9-9c5f-4385-b17b-d4b700c615da": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5de03f9-9c5f-4385-b17b-d4b700c615da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ebc25481-739a-4b04-8b5f-cce7aaf8d992", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "5f880b782418999cc476eeba2d525752430fb82fb95cd49bc1eaee78f1efdfc5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "49 Inputs and Getting Started\nThe estimation of the surface to fill the holes introduces fake information that should \nbe identified and tracked during the processing. In the case of big holes, such as the holes in occluded areas shown in Figure 2.7 , the lack of anatomical shape of these \npatches can be evident. These occluded areas are affected by a person\u2019s pose as well as their body size and shape. Therefore, when assessing accuracy and reliability for measurements of interest, we must consider a variety of sizes and shapes.\nOne of the biggest differences between manual tools and scanners is the data \nprocessing required and its effect on the measurement values. The measurements we get from manual tools typically do not need additional processing or calculation, but scanners require some post-scanning processing. If we are using accurate scans to identify landmark locations, we will need to translate the scan into a format that is readable by a software tool for identifying landmark locations. In addition, some software tools, particularly CAD tools, require watertight models which necessitate more processing than a simple format translation. When we measure with a scan-ner, we are measuring a digital copy of the person. The quality of the copy impacts the quality of the measurement. To get a good quality copy, we need good quality processing. This does not necessarily come with the scanner when it is purchased.\nWe must connect the points in the point cloud in some way to get a surface. If we \ncreate a surface, we are adding data points that were not captured, so they are not the true surface. This makes them less accurate than the actual points in the point cloud. We must take this into account when we evaluate accuracy.\nA variety of algorithms (public or proprietary) are used to generate a 3D body \nmesh that connects the points to create a surface. One is called a polygonal mesh, which connects points to create a surface with flat triangles.

The polygonal mesh uses the original points and adds flat surfaces to fill the holes. The NURBS method moves some of the original points to better fit a curved surface and adds surfaces to fill holes. Both add points that are not in the scan and NURBS also drops some of the original points to create a smoother surface. This makes a more natural looking surface, but it smooths away feature details in the process and is less accurate.\nThe original point cloud is compared to a polygonal mesh and a NURBS water -\ntight model in Figure 2.8 . The polygonal mesh in this figure is not watertight. In \nother words, the larger holes between points remain to be filled. Sometimes investi -\ngators choose to use curved surfaces in these areas.

A raw 3D mesh converted directly from triangles to surfaces is not usable for \na parametric CAD environment. Each triangle of the 3D body mesh is converted into a single surface, obtaining a model made of thousands of surfaces difficult to operate if the software can import it at all without crashing. The conversion of a 3D mesh into a single or a few numbers of parametric surfaces is not trivial and can introduce inaccuracies in the data. In addition, even if it can be converted and imported into CAD, it can still be very slow or can crash the system. So, if this is something desired be sure to test to ensure it works before you buy into the system.\nEven if a watertight version of a scan is produced, it is important to keep the \noriginal scan. The two versions can be compared, so we know which points are actual scan points and which are modified or created by the model. This is one way to assess of precision and accuracy. This can be particularly important when using a CAD model to create our product prototype and is one reason why the CAD models inaccurately portray fit such that live subjects are needed for testing.\nThe definition and control of the posture and body positioning during the mea -\nsuring session are perhaps of the greatest sources of measuring error and difference. Postures need to be defined well enough so they can be duplicated, and they must be able to be maintained for the duration of the measurement. The postures possible and maintainable differ for manual versus scanning tools.\nThis is an area where 4D body scanning with 3D surface details (not just motion \ncapture of landmarks) excels.

This impacts the com -\nparability of 1D measurements extracted from scans to 1D measurements taken with \nother tools.\nFor example, for full body scanning in the standard postures, the armpits and \ncrotch are typically occluded ( Kouchi, 2014 ; Bragan\u00e7a et al., 2018 ). To get data in \nthese areas, the arms and legs must be separated and the separation sometimes must \nbe quite large for some of the larger subjects. When this is done, the measurements \nrelated to the shoulders and hips change ( Gill & Parker, 2017 ; Kouchi & Mochimaru, \n2005 ; Mckinnon & Istook, 2002 ). Kouchi and Mochimaru measured two subjects \nusing a motion capture system as they move their arms from 0-degree arm abduction \nangle (vertical position) to an abduction angle of 90 degrees (horizontal position) \n(Kouchi & Mochimaru, 2005 ). They found that Acromial Height remains con -\nstant up to an approximate angle of 20 degrees, after that, it increases substantially. \nFor both subjects, it increased approximately 20 mm from the 20-degree angle to \nthe 50-degree angle. Biacromial Breadth got smaller as the abduction angle was \nincreased and was noticeable at just a 5 degrees of abduction of the arms. For sub -\nject 1, the Biacromial Breadth decreased from approximately 440 mm to 390 mm \nbetween the abduction angles of 20 and 50 degrees, a difference of 50 mm. For \nsubject 2, the Biacromial Breadth decreases from approximately 410 mm to 370 mm \nbetween the abduction angles of 20 and 50 degrees, a difference of 40 mm.\nRegarding the position of the feet, the optimal separation to ensure the integrity \nof the data, avoiding hidden areas as much as possible, is 10.16 cm according to the \nstudy carried out by Mckinnon and Istook (2002) . However, this position of the feet \napart increases the measurement of the hip contour with respect to the natural pos -\nture, by almost 1 cm, depending on the height at which the hip measurement is taken \n(Gill & Parker, 2017 ).\nAnother aspect of posture is the change of the body as the subject breathes. \nFor some measurements, particularly for measurements or scans of the torso, it is \nimportant to monitor and/or control breathing during measurement. Manual mea -\nsurements, such as Chest Circumference, are done by recording the measurement \nat a specific point in the breathing process. For example, in the 1968 USAF survey, \nthe Bust Circumference was recorded at the \u201cpoint of maximum quiet inspiration\u201d \n(Clauser et al., 1972 ). This would be the largest value of the tape when the subject is \nquietly breathing.\nIn the ISO standard for basic human body measurements ( ISO 7250-1:2017, \n2017 ), the breathing conditions are not specified with each individual measure -\nment description. Instead, there is a statement that \u201cChest and other measurements \naffected by breathing should be taken during gentle breathing\u201d.\nWith 3D scanning, the scan is often not instantaneous, so watching the breath and \ntaking the measure at one specific point is not possible. Breathing must be controlled \nin some other way ( Daanen et al., 1997 ; Kouchi, 2014 ; Lu & Wang, 2010 ; Mckinnon \n& Istook, 2002 ; Perkins et al., 2000 ; Pheasant, 2014 ).

Maintaining normal breathing is recom -\nmended to reduce variation in these measurements due to respiration. For scanners that take several seconds to complete a scan, we will not know the point at which the breathing process was scanned.\nNowadays, the progress of computer vision technology enables the use of real-\ntime detection of joints in video images that can be used to help the posture adoption during the scanning session. An alternative used in some studies is a special physical support for the hands. This system needs to be adjusted to the arm length of each subject and later on should be deleted from the body scan to avoid interferences dur -\ning the measuring extraction.\nThe position and direction of the measurement are defined using reference planes \n(defining horizontal, vertical, etc.) and landmarks. Landmarks are reference points that indicate a location on the body. We use them for measuring, modeling, and for tracking motion or animating the body.\nThe landscape of current standards related to anthropometry and 3D body scan-\nning is very diverse since they are developed by several international organizations and targeted at different applications ( McDonald et al., 2018 ). The main focus of the \nstandards is the definition of landmarks and body measurements: ISO 8559-1 (2017) \nand ASTM D5219-15 (2015) provide body measurement designations and defini -\ntions for garment construction, ISO 7250-1 ( 2017 ) for ergonomic design and ISAK \nfor shape tracking in health, sports, and fitness. All these standards always refer to anatomical landmarks of the body to define the dimensions. The recent standards ISO 18825-1 (2016) and ISO 18825-2 ( 2016 ) provide measurement and landmark \ndefinitions for virtual models used in digital fashion. They are the first standards addressing the definition of body measurements, landmarks, body parts, and joint definitions from a natively digital perspective.\nWhether we are measuring with manual tools or scanners, it is important to locate \nand pre-mark landmarks before scanning. It is important that pre-marked land -\nmarks are visible in the scans for identification after scanning. ISO 20685 states that \u201cLandmarks should be marked on the skin, and then identified with dots or other techniques that can be seen on the displayed image, and distinguished using the available software\u201d (ISO 20685-1, 2018).\nSome scanners that include images of the body surface can detect flat stickers of a \ncontrasting color, such as those shown in Figure 2.10  placed before scanning. However, \nsome scanners do not have the ability to see flat stickers or markers and others have areas of the surface that are at such an angle to the scanner that a flat mark on the sur -\nface cannot be seen. In these instances, the only way to \u201csee\u201d a landmark is to place a 3D volumetric marker such as a sphere or cube of known and calibrated size. Some examples of 3D markers as visible in a scan are also shown in Figure 2.10 .\nVolumetric markers make artificial bumps on the surface, so they need to be \nremoved during the processing stage to avoid undesirable artifacts on the measuring extraction. It is recommended to use the minimal size for these markers to be more precise in the landmark location. 3D body scanners that include image capture of the surface are better for the measurement of physical markers.

All methods require software tools for identifying landmarks and these \ntools do not necessarily come with the scanner. It is important to verify with the scanner manufacturer that landmark recognition tools are available and to test them to ensure they work effectively.\nFor example, for the CAESAR\u2122 project, the 3D landmarks were identified man -\nually using custom-developed landmarking software ( Blackwell et al., 2002 ). The \nlandmarks had been pre-identified with stickers before scanning and the landmarks were identifiable from surface images without having to create a watertight mesh. This process is illustrated in Figure 2.11 .\nThe scanner, the Cyberware WBS\u2122, had color cameras in addition to the data \nscanner. The color cameras took photos of the surface. The photos were aligned to the data file in the software tool, Integrate ( Burnsides et al., 1996 ). This made the \nlandmark stickers visible. Figure 2.11  shows the photos overlaid on the data file and \nthe software tool process for identifying the 3D coordinates of a landmark. A person points, with a cursor, to a sticker that was placed on the subject before scanning and a window pops up with a closer view of the point. The viewer then selects the cen -\nter of the point to identify the landmark location and moves to the next point. This manual \u201cpoint-picking\u201d process was used for the first surveys and the process was later automated.\nManual landmarking of the body prior to scanning, as was done for the CAESAR\u2122 \nproject ( Robinette et al., 2002 ), can be time-consuming and is not feasible for a per -\nson who is self-scanning. Therefore, several scanner manufacturers provide soft -\nware tools to automatically obtain a set of measurements from a scan. In this case, the landmarks are automatically calculated using geometric features of the body shape (e.g., prominent points, curvatures, and minimum/maximum circumferences). \nFIGURE 2.10  Markers for landmarks.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2062, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da144489-2c01-4d29-b90d-3ce41bfd5631": {"__data__": {"id_": "da144489-2c01-4d29-b90d-3ce41bfd5631", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "055934b4-8290-447a-9849-6b5f62d9b2a8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "672bbf5138573f88ade2e1cecf9577140ce2fb0150a9c41dfa2829c50ea37676", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "55 Inputs and Getting Started\nCaution must be used with these tools because they produce less robust and accurate \nresults.

Subject 1 is a thin subject and the minimum horizontal girth of the torso is much higher than where she wears the waist of her garments.

As a result, the extracted \nmeasurement location and reliability assessment may not reflect the true location and \nreliability on all body types. This can lead to poor or missing data on some segments \nof the population and bias in the results.\nThe Omphalion landmark is visible in the scans, so it might be used as a land -\nmark. It might provide a more consistent measurement, but it is not a reliable indica -\ntor of where the waist of the wearable will be worn. Many functional and relevant \nmeasurements for wearables are complex and horizontal and vertical directions are \nnot sufficient. Yet, without multiple landmarks to guide the computer measurement, \nthe only options are to specify horizontal and vertical as the measurement direction. \nIn this example, we had a horizontal measurement, but the waist where we wear our \nclothes is rarely if ever horizontal. We typically prefer the waist of our clothes to be \nlower in the front than in the back. Even for subject 1, the measurement dips in front. \nFor subject 2, the difference between the front and the back is even more extreme.  \nIt is important for wearable development to have identified and visible landmarks \nsufficient to determine the location of the wearable.\nThe errors due to the automatic processing of scans depend on several criteria \nincluding (1) the availability of landmarks that are visible without pre-marking,  \n(2) location and direction definitions that hold up for all body shapes and sizes, and \n(3) the robustness and consistency of the algorithms. The definition of measurements \nof traditional anthropometry based on anatomy does not work for most automatic digital \nmeasurements.\nEven if we have reliable pre-marked digital landmarks for the 3D body scan, it is \nstill necessary to use mathematical functions to calculate measurements and, except \nfor the shortest straight distance between two points, the translation of the anthro -\npometric definitions to mathematical algorithms is not standardized. As a result, the \ninterpretation to implement the definition of body measurements in algorithms var -\nies among commercial systems and research studies.\nAll factors described earlier influence traditional and digital measurements in \ndifferent ways producing a lack of compatibility between both methods ( Han et al., \n2010 ; Kouchi, 2014 ). This is confirmed by several published studies that compare \ntraditional and digital measurements of a sample group of subjects being particularly \nrelevant for the body contours ( Kouchi, 2014 ; Kouchi & Mochimaru, 2005 ; Lu & \nWang, 2010 ; Perkins et al., 2000 ).\nA reliability study of anthropometric methods done by the IEEE 3D body pro -\ncessing group compared traditional manual methods and new 3D body scanning \ntechnologies. The study was done in two phases measuring in total 132 subjects by \nfive different experts on manual anthropometry, four different body scanners, and \nfour mobile applications (Ballester et al., 2020). The results indicated significant \nbiases of up to several centimeters between pairs of 3D body scanners. This could \nbe related to the different algorithms used by each 3D body scanner to calculate the \nbody measurements.\nOnly direct straight-line distances between anatomical points marked by palpa -\ntion for both traditional and digital measurements are comparable.

The straight-line distance \nbetween two points is not affected by direction, surface contours, or hidden areas; \ntherefore, they have the least amount of measurement error of all the measurement \ntypes, provided the landmarks are accurately placed and precisely identified in the \nscans. Any measurements that follow along the surface such as a Waist Circumference \nor a length that simulates one taken with a tape measure will not be as reliable.\nPhysical Fit Measurement Tools\nObjective fit tools measure the location, stability, and performance effects of the \nhuman interface with the wearable in a way that does not require an opinion. All \nwearables are meant to be worn in a particular location on the body and for some \nwearables, this location is more specific and critical than others. For example, some \nhave components that must be visible to the eyes, and some have components that \nmust be in the right place with respect to the ear canal for the person to hear, and so \non. For wearables with stringent location requirements, the wearable must be able to \nstay in that place and continue to function properly while the person is wearing it for \nthe expected activities. We refer to this as stability. Performance means the wearer \ncan do their tasks well and safely, without interference due to poor fit. For example, if \na coverall is too loose or too tight, it might hinder reach and movement. Or, a protec -\ntive suit may gap and expose the skin during movement.\nBoth stability and performance measurement require testing with the subjects \nmoving or dynamic testing. There are a variety of tools and methods for this type of \ntesting and we review a few here that have been used to provide some ideas for inter -\nface measurement. This is not an exhaustive list. It is merely intended to offer some \nsuggestions. New wearable products can be unique, so specialized test methods may \nneed to be developed.\nLocation measurement can be as simple as measuring with a ruler the amount of \nfabric offset from the body, as was shown in the fit-mapping manual by Choi et al. \n(2009) . They showed how they pinched the sides of a coverall at the hip level and \nmeasured the width of the fabric in the pinch on each side. They called this amount \nthe ease and suggested fit scores based on the range of ease, with a good fit having \n2.5 to 4 inches of ease. The decision about how much ease is acceptable can be \ndecided before testing or after. Regardless, it is best to record the actual measure -\nment just in case we might change our minds about what is acceptable later. Other \nfit criteria may be more important, such as the ability to move or reach, that might \nchange our minds about what is acceptable. For example, the acceptable fit might not \nlook as pretty, but it might function better.\nIf we want to visualize and measure the location of the product when worn to \nensure proper placement for performance, such as an optical display, then 3D scan -\nning with and without the product in place may be essential. This is something \nthat is usually not possible to measure reliably with calipers and tape measures. \nExamples of software tools for superimposing the scans or images include Blender\u2122, \nPowerPoint\u2122, or Photoshop\u2122.

At the left is an image of the 3D scan of a subject with the helmet in place and his pupil landmark has been identified. The helmet also has five pre-marked landmarks, one in front and two on each side. These are used to put the data into a helmet-based axis system for measuring the locations of impor -\ntant landmarks. This axis system is shown at the right in the figure. The Helmet Center-Left and Helmet Center-Right landmarks define one helmet orientation axis (x). This axis is not visible because it is perpendicular to this 2D view, but it is located at the origin. A line from the Helmet Front landmark to the x-axis defines a second axis (z). The first three points together also define a plane, the xz plane. A third axis is defined as perpendicular to this plane and starting at the center of the left and right Helmet Center landmarks. The center point of the three axes is called the origin, and it is the point that has the value of zero for all directions, denoted (0,0,0).\nThe helmet-based axis system allows us to measure where each subject is located \nin the helmet. This can also help to track the independent movement of the wearable and the body or slippage if the scan is taken before and after physical activities. This works well for wearables that have some rigid components that are visible in a scan but not as well for soft wearables.\nWhen combined with fit scores that identify areas of concern, these visualizations \nhelp us understand both underlying causes and solutions. For example, in Figure 2.14 , \nwe show the estimated distribution of right pupil locations in a helmet that was cal -\nculated by overlaying scans and measuring the locations for more than 100 subjects. The distribution is represented with two ellipses, one enclosing 95% of the subjects, \nFIGURE 2.13  3D scan of subject in a helmet with helmet-based axis system.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2324, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "641e237c-1bf9-4d9e-abfe-0efa22eb0981": {"__data__": {"id_": "641e237c-1bf9-4d9e-abfe-0efa22eb0981", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2998dc2b-5e26-446f-be84-d65dff05c126", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "59", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "f636dee3cb3956de086827a3e3b784df8e56ac203693e168e6d6420b9fd48d5a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "59 Inputs and Getting Started\nand one enclosing 99%.

In this example, the pupil location was intended to \nbe 2 inches below the edge roll but the true location ranged from 2 to 4 inches. We also see that there is an angle to the location which means helmet rotation is a factor. This was unexpected when we modeled this in CAD.\nIn Figure 2.15 , we show a simple tool to measure the location of the bottom of \nthe sleeve from the wrist landmark. It is a quick and standardized, repeatable way to identify and record if the sleeve is long, short, or just right.\nStability is more difficult to measure than location. The most common and often \nthe most effective method is a subjective assessment and a questionnaire. This can be assessed by asking subjects questions about how much it moved and recording responses on a scale or by having the investigator score the movement or slippage. For this method, we need a prescribed set of movements or activities for each subject to perform. The activities should be related to whatever activities they would be expected to have while wearing the wearable.\nAn alternative is to devise some method to measure how much the product \nmoves during activities. In their report on the fit assessment of three helmet systems (Blackwell & Robinette, 1993 ), the authors used two stability assessment methods, \none subjective with a questionnaire and one objective with a measurement of the movement during activity. For the subjective assessment, they had the subject do a set of movements and the investigator scored the movement on a scale of 1 to 5, \nFIGURE 2.14  Range of pupil locations in a helmet.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1944, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2097873c-244b-4a56-9216-f00f5a657cbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "2097873c-244b-4a56-9216-f00f5a657cbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ccb3a999-fa77-40fa-b6bb-4c5d7c949fb6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "60", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "a805e242b91741fecf8661c37a4a784e06303d19ca966f15f7fa7de49869c28d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "60 Product Fit and Sizing\nwith 1 representing the lack of movement and 5 representing excessive movement. \nFor the objective assessment, they attached a ballpoint pen to the helmet in such a way that it would draw on the subject\u2019s forehead as the helmet moved around during the same movements. They scored the movement in 5 mm increments, from good  \n(1\u20135 mm) to poor (20 mm or more). The helmet would re-seat itself to its original position when the subject stopped moving such that having the ink path showing how much it travelled during movement was more effective than simply measuring before and after movement.\nMotion capture systems and 4D measurement systems have become more precise \nand capable than they were in the 1990s and can provide a good way to measure stability for some products. It will depend on the product, the way it is worn, and the visibility of both body surface and wearable landmarks. If the appropriate body and wearable landmarks are visible during movement, these tools might be an alternative to consider, particularly if they are also suitable for performance measurement of the product so that added expense can be justified.\nPerformance measurement requires us to measure whether the subject can do the \nactivities they need to do well and safely with the wearable performing as intended. This is very dependent on the wearable. For example, we might measure if the mask seals out toxins by measuring the ppm of particles that get inside a chemical protec -\ntive mask while the subject does physical exercises. This would require a special measuring chamber as was used for the testing of the MCU-2P mask ( Case et al., \n1989 ).

Choi et al. have some good examples for \nassessing mobility or the ability to move and perform tasks ( Choi et al., 2009 ). They \ndescribe a motion or a task and list the pass/fail criteria as a three-level assessment: \npass, pass with difficulty, or fail.\nReach and grip strength have been included in anthropometric measurement sur -\nveys such as the survey of Army Women in the 1970s ( Laubach et al., 1977 ). These \nmeasurements can be taken with and without the wearable to determine if the wear -\nable interferes with reach or strength abilities.\npeRsonne L anD FaCILItIes\nBefore we begin the design process and the iterative testing required, we need to \nacquire, train, and assess the personnel we need and acquire facilities that are safe, \nsecure, equipped, maintainable, and accessible. There are several aspects of acces -\nsibility. First, both our physical spaces and our software tools must be accessible to \npeople with disabilities. Second, we must have the proper clearances and approvals \nto use the facilities and conduct testing with human subjects. Finally, we must have \na shared data space that is accessible to all members of the team and properly main -\ntained for long-term use.\nPersonnel\nPersonnel, who are skilled and trained for data collection, analysis, and management \nare needed for good outcomes of these processes. It is usually best if we have more \nthan one person doing data collection and testing, and it is a good idea to have one \nperson who functions as the team lead who understands the whole process. When \nwe have a team of people, some of them can specialize in certain areas, such as data \ncollection or data processing, and not have to be trained and skilled at everything. \nThe team members\u2019 roles include the following:\n\u2022 Team lead/project manager: This person coordinates the project, manages \nthe team, and solves problems as they arise. This can include presenting \nproposals and results to company management, conducting quality assur -\nance audits, answering detailed questions, making decisions when there \nis debate, and collecting body scans, photographs, or other information to \nillustrate and document fit issues.\n\u2022 Trainer/senior anthropometrist: If the individual team members have not \nhad anthropometric training, this person would be the individual who pro -\nvides the training.

For anthropometric measurement, data collection is best to plan to have at \nleast two investigators working together because the measuring is faster and more \nreliable. For example, for manual measuring, the placement of the tools with respect \nto the subject can be viewed from two directions at once making it more precise. \nAlso, one person can be measuring, while the other records the values and gets tools \nready for the next measurement. This can cut data collection time in half.\nIf the data collection will be ongoing for several weeks, it is valuable to have \ntrained backup data collectors. It is difficult enough to get subjects to show up with -\nout having to cancel appointments because a team member is ill or on leave. If all \nteam members are trained for all data collection types and roles, it enables people to \ntrade-off jobs to stay fresh or take breaks.\nData analysis can be done by someone who is not part of data collection, but they \nwill need to understand how the data are collected. It is also helpful if the data col -\nlection team members understand a bit about how the data will be analyzed. That \nwill help them make better decisions when issues arise.\nIdeally, the designer or engineer for the product should be the fit assessor or at a \nminimum be involved in the fit assessment. If not possible, they should at least be pres -\nent for the pilot testing as this is where the main learning about the product occurs.\nAll data collection team members should be trained and practiced for three reasons: \n(1) to learn how to interact with subjects, (2) to collect high good quality data, and  \n(3) to save time and money on testing. Trained teams can collect data quickly, accurately, \nand with a smooth transition to analysis meaning reliable results will be ready rapidly.\nThere are two types of training: individual investigator training and team train -\ning. Individual training brings each team member up to the level of training they \nneed for their role and team training coordinates the methods for the whole team.\nIndividual training includes things such as anthropometry training, training on \nthe software tools that will be used, training on research with human subjects, train -\ning on data structuring for analysis, training on fit assessment, and training in the \nrelevant statistical procedures and software tools. Individual training can take sev -\neral weeks or months, depending on the skill and experience of the team members, \nso this needs to be factored into planning. However, it will not need to be done for \nevery test. It will only need to be updated if some of the tools to be used are upgraded \nor changed. Individual training both minimizes the individual data collection error \ncalled intra-observer error and speeds up the data collection process enabling quality \ndata with minimal time.\nTeam training is done with two or more team members at a time after the indi -\nviduals have completed their baseline training. It is intended to ensure that they are \nmeasuring, scoring, and recording the same and to optimize the flow of the test.

Human beings are constantly fluctuating, \nso they are a moving target for measurement. For example, when we breathe, our \ntorso moves in and out, so measurements there get larger and smaller. When we get \nup in the morning, we are taller than when we go to bed at night because our spine \ncompresses gradually throughout the day. When we stand, we do not stand still but \nwe sway to maintain our posture. We lose and gain weight during the day and our \nblood pressure goes up and down. All these things and more can affect the mea -\nsurement values and the impact can be minimized with training and measurement \nstandardization.\nThe amount of error that we, as individuals, can expect to have, regardless of \nhow good and practiced we are, differs depending on the measurement. Larger \nmeasurements, such as stature, can be expected to have larger error than smaller \nmeasurements, such as Hand Length. In addition, different measurers (also called \nobservers) will take measurements differently for a variety of reasons such as dif -\nferent amounts of pressure applied or different interpretations of the measurement \nlocations. Following good protocols and training the measuring team properly is \ncrucial to minimizing errors.\nA good anthropometry training program should include training in calibration \ntechniques, anatomy terminology, anatomy of underlying bony landmarks, proper \npositioning of subjects, use of different measuring tools, proper placement of tools \non the body, and assessment of inter- and intra-observer measurement reliability for \nlive subjects. Informal training that does not include these things is not enough. The \nlarger the error, the more subjects we need to make good decisions, so training can \nreduce the cost of fit testing in the long run.\nAnthropometry is used in many fields with different purposes such as sports sci -\nence, biological anthropology, archaeology, health, and engineering. Some mea -\nsurements are unique to the field. For example, sports science has a focus on human \nmovement and sports performance, so they are interested in measuring biceps, skin -\nfolds, and movement angles. The health field is interested in measurements like Waist \nCircumference or body mass index (BMI) in relation to say, cardiovascular risk fac -\ntors. What all the fields share are techniques in how to measure, even if the measure -\nments themselves and applications are different. Their training programs can provide \ngood training in anatomy, landmarks, the use of tools, body positioning, and dealing \nwith human subjects. However, training on the measurements and tools specific to \nthe design and engineering of a specific type of product may need to be added to the \ntraining curriculum. Sometimes this additional, product specific training can be done \nas part of team training if the individual training provides a good anatomical base.\nGood training can be obtained from any experienced anthropometrist who has a \nhigh level of anatomical knowledge and has been involved in anthropometric surveys. \nThe organization ISAK (International Standard for Anthropometric Assessment) \noffers anthropometry training, as does Anthrotech Inc. ( https://anthrotech.net /).\nThe training program designed by ISAK includes the theory and practice for \ngathering anthropometric measurements for sports and health applications.

It is best to \ngive it a unique name, so it is not listed as the same name but be a different measure -\nment from an existing measurement.\nThere have been several studies regarding measuring errors relevant to design \nand engineering. For the Army ANSUR surveys, they called acceptable measure -\nment repeatability \u201callowable error\u201d ( Gordon & Bradtmiller, 1992 ; Gordon et al., \n1989 , 2014).

If after training, the measurement is reliable, then having \nrepeated measures during the study does not substantially improve its reliability, \nand so they are not worth the expense. Thus, for design and engineering purposes, \nrepeated measures are needed during training but are not usually necessary in the \ntest or data collection study itself.\nHotzman et al. (2011)  build upon the work of Gordon et al. (1989)  and present \nallowable error values for a list of body measurements. They used the allowable \nerror values for measurer training as well as to track or \u201crecalibrate\u201d during data \ncollection. Tracking measurement repeatability was done because data collection \nlasted several months and the team traveled to different geographic locations. Most \nindividual fit tests are much shorter in duration and should not require checking \nrepeatability after the initial training period. However, if there are many fit tests and \nthere are gaps of weeks or months between tests, it is a good idea to have a training \nrefresher  before the test starts, particularly if the different tests will be compared.\nThe key sources for measurement error within and between measurers are as \nfollows:\n\u2022 Obtaining and maintaining the subject\u2019s posture\n\u2022 Landmark definition and landmark location\n\u2022 Positioning tools and measurer\nPosture can also be called pose or position of the subject. Each 1D measurement \nis taken with the subject in a single posture or pose. The posture of the subject is \none of the aspects that most influence anthropometric measurements and is usually \nthe largest source of measuring error. It is important to understand what posture was \nused in a study and to copy the posture exactly if collecting new data that will be \ncompared to a study.\nWhen a posture is difficult to assume or maintain while measuring, it requires \nvigilance on the part of the measurer to ensure the measurement is taken with the \nsubject in the correct position. For example, many people tend to slump and standing \nor sitting erect can be difficult to maintain. This variation in posture can have large \neffects on the resulting measurements and in the variation with repeated measur -\ning. This is true regardless of the measuring tools used. For example, if a person is \nstanding erect in one 3D scan and slumped in another, their measurements will be \nvery different. Also, if one person is scanned standing erect but another is slumped, \nthey might have very similar measurements, but their measurements will appear to \nbe very different. Therefore, it is very important to include careful positioning and \nrepeated measurements in the measuring team training.\nThe location of anatomical points presents repeatability errors due to the skills \nand training of the measurer. The difference between the measurements taken on the \nsame subject by the same measurer is known as intra-observer error and is a random \nerror ( Kouchi, 2014 ).

Especially with a new measurement. When estimating the \nallowable error, you can get a rough idea from a similar measurement. These can \nbe looked up in ISO 20685. In the case of inter-observer error, the values usually \nreferred to in the state-of-the-art are those reported by Gordon et al. (1989)  who \nevaluated inter-observer measurement errors of four experienced anthropometrists \nusing the marks of one technician. However, in a real situation, each measurer used \nits own marks and takes its own measurements. In practice, inter-observer errors are \nslightly higher than these reference values.\nThe influence of landmarking errors on manual anthropometry was quantified by \nKouchi (2014)  for both intra and inter-observer errors. The study was done measur -\ning 40 subjects, which is a recommended sample size to perform a pilot study of \nthe measuring protocols. The results of the intra-observer mean absolute difference \n(MAD) show that 4 out of 34 anthropometric measurements are higher than the \nmaximum allowable error of ISO 20685. The ranges of intra-observer MAD reported \nare 4.4\u20138.5 mm for heights, 3.5\u20137.4 mm for breadths, 5.4\u201313.9 mm for circumfer -\nences (Waist Circumference being the maximum MAD value), and 1.5\u20134.2 mm  \nfor small measurements (e.g., hand length, head length, and foot breath). These \nranges are a good reference to assess the repeatability of traditional anthropomet -\nric protocols. With good training and systematic in following the protocols, inter-\nobserver error can be minimized until a certain point. It is important to take into \nconsideration that we are not measuring an object. We are measuring an articulated \nbody consequently due to the posture variations and breathing, repeated measure -\nments always will vary.\nIn the case of anthropometric studies or fit testing experiments that include a large \nnumber of subjects, the participation of several measurers is very common. When \ndifferent technicians are gathering the anthropometric measurements, there are also \nsystematic biases between measurers that also affect the variance of the anthropo -\nmetric measurements. Thus, the difference between the measurements taken by two \ndifferent measurers, the inter-observer error, depends on the magnitude of the bias \nand the magnitude of the intra-observer error ( Kouchi, 2014 ). This means that the \ninter-observer error will be larger than the intra-observer error because it includes \nthe bias plus the intra-observer error. The bias between measurers is mainly due to \ndifferences in the interpretation and execution of the measurement protocol and that \nunderscores why training is important.\nIn general, when a new test that includes anthropometric measurements is planned, \nit is recommended:\n1. To define and document the measurement protocols\n2. That training is led by a criterion anthropometrist\n3. To train the measurement team using the documented protocols\n4. To perform a reliability study to determine the repeatability and inter-observer \nerrors\n5.

Changing the criteria to landmark the body\nThese modifications during or after data collection introduce serious difficul -\nties when comparing data among successive studies performed during the prod -\nuct development loop. They create issues tracking the progress of the product \ndesign.\nAllowable error should be below the tolerance of specifications related to the \napplications of the data, the type of product, material, and fitting requirements. \nThese specifications should be defined at the first stage of the design process.\nFacilities\nFor smooth and timely testing, there are important logistics of the test site, people \ninvolved, and product availability to be considered. It is a good idea to document \nthese in a data collection plan before beginning testing to serve as a guide, to track \nchanges, and to document for future reference. Four of the most important categories \nof considerations are discussed in this section. These are as follows:\n\u2022 Use of human subjects\n\u2022 Test site considerations\n\u2022 Subject attire\n\u2022 Product information record\nWe have found it is best to have a dry run pilot test of the data collection process \nprior to the first test as well. If there are any problems, it is best to find them before \ntesting starts. This can be done as part of team training or as part of a test of the COF. \nIt does not necessarily have to be repeated each time a new test is done unless some \nof the procedures have changed.\nUse of Human Subjects\nGood practices when using human subjects not only ensure the privacy, health, and \nsafety of the subjects but also protect the interest of the organization doing the test -\ning. Different countries have different laws and regulations so be sure to review the \nlatest in any country in which data collection will occur.\nWhether it is required by law or not, it is a good idea to have informed consent. \nInforming each subject about what they will do and what will happen in the study \nbefore beginning and getting them to sign an informed consent form ensures that we \nknow of any potential issues an individual might have before we start, reassures the \nsubject, and reduces the risk of litigation later. For example, while we were explain -\ning the fit test procedures to a subject for a fit test of a coverall, we learned she had \nbeen exposed to poison ivy, so she had particularly sensitive skin that would impact \nher fit scores.

It is a good idea to have in place and explain how we will protect their pri -\nvacy for things such as their image, their age, their health status, and their weight. \nOne way to protect data privacy is to separate their name and identifiers from their \nother data. This can be done by assigning them a subject number and keeping a sepa -\nrate and protected file that indicates which number they were assigned.\nImages can be handled either by getting consent to use and publish their image \nincluding their 3D scan or by blurring the image such that it will not be recognizable. \nIn some countries, informed consent is not sufficient.\nTest subjects need to be treated with respect and be helped to feel relaxed. \nExplaining everything that will happen ahead of time helps. It is also important to \nkeep an eye on the subject during the process. Some people get nervous enough to \nfeel faint and pass out while they are being measured. If someone seems to wobble, \noffer them a chair, and have them sit until they feel better.\nTest Site Considerations\nData collection can occur in many different locations and not always in our labo -\nratory. To attract people from different TPs, we often must go where they are \nlocated and find and use facilities far removed from our home office. Even at our \nhome office, if fit testing is a new endeavor for a company, sometimes we must \nfind a suitable place. Here are some tips for finding, creating, and using a suitable \nspace.\nFirst, the space must be large enough to contain all of the tools, prototypes in all \nsizes, furniture, and all the people who will need to be in each area of the space at \none time. The furniture should include a chair for each subject being tested or wait -\ning to be tested and each investigator. The space should be partitioned such that the \ntest subjects are not able to see each other while they are being tested. This can lead \nto bias and influence in the results.\nIt is best if there is a meet and greet area separated from the test area for meet -\ning new subjects as they arrive, explaining the test procedures, and having them fill \nout any forms. This keeps the new subjects from being influenced by subjects who \nare being tested and prevents disturbing the ongoing testing. It is also a good place \nto keep control data collection logistics. For example, Volume II of the CAESAR\u2122 \nstudy report describes the tasks at their meet and greet station, which they referred to \nas the \u201cDemographics station\u201d ( Blackwell et al., 2002 ).

Nylon wig caps \nhave worked well for head scanning.

The place for their belongings should either be within their sight or somehow secured.\nRoom temperature and lighting can influence subjects, so it is important that the \nlevels are considered before starting testing. They should reflect the temperature and light levels of the environment in which the wearable will be used.\nIt is often necessary or useful to have several different data collection stations. \nHotzman et al. (2011) provide nice descriptions of several different measuring stations used for anthropometric surveys for the U.S. Army and Marine Corps. By using different stations, many subjects can be processed at the same time and the data collection process goes much faster, as the team at each measuring station has fewer things to remember and they become proficient at their station very quickly.\nThere should be facilities and equipment to keep the tools and spaces clean. \nMeasuring tools should be cleaned after each use. If apparel items are provided and will be re-used, then there should be a plan for laundering the items.\nTARGET POPULATION SAMPLING AND PLANNING\nA sample in statistics is a set of observations or items drawn from a population. It is usually a subset of a population taken in a limited time frame that is used to estimate the larger population. Collecting a large enough sample, with sufficient representa -\ntion of important categories is one way we manage and reduce measurement uncer -\ntainty. A TP sample consists of the people collected (subjects) and the measurements or information gathered about each person.\nThree different types of anthropometry and demographics samples representing \nthe TP are collected during the design process: (1) the starting TP sample, (2) the fit test samples, and (3) the full TP sample. They are described in Table 2.11 .\nFirst, a sample is used to select and assess cases or fit models to design and mock-up \nor prototype the product as well as check the range of variability of the measurements. This sample is the first approximation of the TP and we refer to this as the starting TP sample.\nSecond, samples are collected to test the fit and performance of the product during \nthe design loop. Many different samples are typically selected during this stage and we refer to these as fit test samples.\nThird, a sample from the TP will be used to determine which sizes to produce, \nhow many of each size to purchase, and how to help users find the correct size (size prediction). We refer to this as the full TP sample and it is typically weighted to better match the TP.\nThe starting TP sample and the full TP sample are similar if we have raw data \nand a large enough sample with all the measurements needed in the starting TP sample. This might be the case for products with similar predecessor products.

The sample should have at least 250 subjects. It does not typically contain fit data. It can be:\n\u2022 Raw data/individual data (best option)\n\u2022 Aggregated data/summary statistics\nFit and performance \ntesting of the  productFit test samples: The purpose is to test fit and performance of prototypes \nthroughout development. Fit test samples are always raw data samples and include fit and performance along with anthropometry and demographics.

These kinds of resources provide a variety of starting samples that can be \nused to select cases.\nNormally it is impossible to find a perfect sample at the start of product develop -\nment, particularly for completely new products. Luckily, at this stage, it does not \nhave to be perfect, because the rest of the design process will refine the product. The starting TP sample just must be close enough to have some confidence that the start -\ning case(s) are reasonable.\nBecause a sample is not the entire population, it is important to capture important \naspects of population variability relevant to the product when gathering or selecting the sample. Demographics that are known to affect variability include the following:\n\u2022 Gender\n\u2022 Age\n\u2022 Racial group\n\u2022 Geographic sales region\n\u2022 Occupation\nFor example, one might think women are just smaller than men, but this is not \nalways true. For some measurements, such as Hip Circumference, women are larger than men on average. This is the case in the North American sample from the CAESAR\u2122 survey ( Blackwell et al., 2002 ) as can be seen in Table 2.12 . Women are \nsmaller for Shoulder Breadth and Stature but larger for Hip Circumference.\nThe combination of smaller and larger proportions means the proportioning is \ndifferent, so a simple small or large scaling may not accommodate both genders. This is illustrated in Figure 2.16  with bivariate plots of Shoulder Breadth and Hip \nCircumference for males and females. There is very little overlap of the two gen -\nders for this measurement combination. The overall mean indicated with a square, falls between the two and does not hit the greatest concentration of people for either gender. If the overall mean is used to create the base size and scaled up and down very few people of either gender would be accommodated. For this reason, it is important to have adequate representation from people of each gender in all sample types if the product is intended for both genders and to analyze results for each gender separately.\nTABLE 2.12\nMeans and Standard Deviations (STD) From CAESAR\u2122 North American Sample\nName of Statistic Males Female Difference\nHip Circumference maximum \u2013 Mean (mm) 1045.9 1053.7 7.8\nHip Circumference maximum \u2013 STD (mm) 97.6 124.5 26.9\nShoulder (Bideltoid) Breadth \u2013 Mean (mm) 495.8 429.8 \u221266.0\nShoulder (Bideltoid) Breadth \u2013 STD (mm) 36.1 35.0 \u22121.2\nStature maximum \u2013 Mean (mm) 1777.4 1639.8 \u2212137.7\nStature \u2013 STD (mm) 78.9 73.3 \u22125.6", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2575, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8c2acfa-b5a9-4757-8c4f-73a02aeb1d9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8c2acfa-b5a9-4757-8c4f-73a02aeb1d9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bb7bbc3a-d9df-4b40-87de-aed8070ec2aa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "73", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "d010441e9147014018f4ea8401812f3f0d22025bf278bda852ccfe4553f3953e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "73 Inputs and Getting Started\nThe same may be true for different racial groups as well. To ensure all racial \ngroups, get an equal quality or level of fit, it is necessary to evaluate the fit with \nsufficient samples from each racial group in the TP. This does not necessarily mean \nthat there are separate size ranges for different racial groups. The ability to equally \naccommodate the different racial groups within a single size range should be deter -\nmined through fit testing. For example, during the fit testing of a jacket for Navy \nwomen ( Mellian et al., 1991 ; Robinette et al., 1991 ), we found that Black women \nfrequently had a poor fit in the waist and hip area, requiring them to have major \nalterations (at their own expense) more often than White women. Evaluation of the \ndata revealed that the issue was a difference in the height/width ratio of the torso ver -\nsus the length of the arms. Black women tended to have shorter torsos but the same \nHip Circumference as White women, while at the same time having longer arms and \nsimilar statures. The shorter torso meant the widest part of the hip was falling higher \nup in the jacket making it bunch up around the waist and gap at the back vent. They \nneeded a shorter jacket in the torso, but the current short jacket had sleeves that were \ntoo short. This was resolved by lengthening the sleeves for the short jacket sizes. The \nsleeves were always hemmed after purchase anyway. By evaluating the fit for both \nracial groups we were able to achieve an equally good fit for everyone without having \nto have separate size ranges.\nThe ideal starting TP sample would be one recently collected and randomly \nsampled from the exact TP of interest and including all relevant measurements and \ndemographics. However, unless the business has existed for a while making similar \nproducts and have been collecting this data, it is unlikely such a sample will be \nfound. Until we do fit testing, we might not know what measurements are relevant, \nFIGURE 2.16  Shoulder Breadth by Hip Circumference, Maximum showing male and female \nsubjects", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2100, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efe9472b-9f4d-4748-924c-9ac965b3a349": {"__data__": {"id_": "efe9472b-9f4d-4748-924c-9ac965b3a349", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e597a4b5-7c88-42dc-80c0-8f16638be0bc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "d4fe861594398b39e76d94fe33a66c580c2deef3324ad8e10bf8721a0cecbdd8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "74 Product Fit and Sizing\nso we cannot know what to measure exactly in advance.

They used the data from the 1967 survey of Air Force males ( Grunhofer & Kroh, 1975 ) that had 187 measure -\nments and found that with just 250 subjects, 93% of the measurements would meet their accuracy criteria. Since this sample was only males, they examined the results from a survey of Air Force Women ( Daniels et al., 1953 ) and found \nsimilar results.\nThe accuracy criteria Churchill and McConville used were primarily based on \nthe amount of variation an individual human being has within the span of one day. Since, the authors note, \u201c\u2026any design which requires design values more precise than the variation which occurs in a human being within a normal day is, ordinarily at least, unrealistic\u201d.\nThe sample size of 30 for the within gender subgroups is based upon the knowl -\nedge that at n = 30 the distribution of the mean becomes closely approximated by the normal distribution, the z distribution. Estimates of the mean are less influenced by any one subject at this point. We might want more than 30 if we think we will have a focus on the subgroup for design or size evaluation at some point.\nFor some samples, a goal is set for each subgroup and random samples are col -\nlected from each subgroup. This is called a stratified random sample. Sampling males and females separately is a stratified random sample with the two genders being two strata. Stratum is a synonym for group and strata is a synonym for groups (the plural). Similar stratified sampling may be used for other subgroups.\nFor the CAESAR\u2122 anthropometric survey, a stratified sampling plan was used \nwith additional strata ( Robinette et al., 2002 ). First, there were country strata. The \ncivilian populations of three countries were sampled to characterize the population of NATO countries. The United States was chosen because it has the largest and the most diverse population in NATO. The Netherlands was chosen because it has the tallest population in NATO, and Italy was chosen because it has one of the shortest populations in NATO. The populations within these countries were sampled by age, race, and gender strata. Stratified sampling goals were used with equal sample size in each strata or cell according to the recommendations of ISO/DIS 15535. The strata (groups) are shown in Table 2.13 .\nStature was used to estimate the within-strata sample sizes.

However, with stratified random sampling, it is necessary to apply a statistical weight to each subject when calculating overall sample statistics because the sample has proportionately more representatives from some groups and fewer representatives from other groups than the overall population.\nSometimes samples or databases are summarized in publications using statistics \nsuch as the mean, STD, and percentiles ( Gordon et al., 2014 ; Harrison & Robinette, \n2002 ; Snyder et al., 1975 ).

They are statistical descriptions of samples. These descriptions are correctly \nreferred to as either aggregate data or summary statistics. This is an important dis -\ntinction because a lot more can be done with raw data than with summary statistics, particularly for tailoring a sample to better match a TP.\nTable 2.15  shows an example from the CAESAR\u2122 survey ( Harrison & Robinette, \n2002 ). In this example, summary statistics for the Waist Front Length measurement \nare shown including the mean, the SEM, STD, and selected percentiles.\nThe mean is an estimate of the middle of the measurement distribution. In other \nwords, it is a statistic that approximates the point at which half of the population is smaller and half is larger. This mean is calculated by adding all the observations and dividing by the sample size. If the distribution follows the normal distribution, this will be the center.\nThe 50th percentile is also an estimate of the middle. In this example, the estimated \n50th percentile is the value at which the sample is divided into two equal parts. This is also called the median. Note that the mean and the 50th percentile, while both esti -\nmates of the middle, appear to be different. The mean and 50th percentile for men are 462.44 mm and 456.12 mm, respectively. The mean and 50th percentile for women are 377.12 mm and 369.9 mm, respectively. The magnitude of the difference between these two estimates is an indicator of how close the distribution of the variable matches the normal distribution.TABLE 2.15\nExample of Summary Statistics\nCAESAR Variable Name: Waist Front Length (mm)\nMean 462.44 377.12\nSEM 1.58 1.31\nSTD 52.85 46.52\nSample size 1119 1261\nPercentiles (mm) Men Women\n1 366.98 303.22\n2 377.63 309.56\n3 383.03 314.36\n5 393.24 322.29\n10 407.08 331.08\n20 424.32 342.97\n25 430.39 348.01\n50 456.12 369.90\n75 488.12 397.95\n80 496.53 407.34\n90 522.39 430.11\n95 547.72 451.11\n97 567.55 466.70\n98 582.50 479.73\n99 616.04 505.78", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2073, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e10ff135-0d6d-458d-b123-195b4043e55d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e10ff135-0d6d-458d-b123-195b4043e55d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1ed0c073-7826-428e-827d-ae35d1241913", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "77", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "0c539388543771a91b4c832fa50583931fad1f2f2e57a3856304bc95f9ea7389", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "77 Inputs and Getting Started\nA third measure of the middle is the mode. The mode is the point at which the \nmost observations are clustered. It is the highest peak on a histogram or bar chart. \nFor finding the starting size and the case or person to represent it, the mode can be the best measure of the middle. It will give us a size where most people are located. The mode is missing from the Harrison and Robinette summary statistics document and it is rarely included in summary statistics documents. This is one reason why raw data are preferable for the TP.\nThe percentiles in Table 2.15  are estimates of the percentages below the percen -\ntile value. In other words, the first percentile is an estimate of the size at which 1% are smaller, the second percentile is an estimate of the size at which 2% are smaller, and so on. The estimates in this example were calculated by counting the subjects whose measurements were smaller.\nAnother way to estimate percentiles is to assume the distribution is normal and use \nthe mean and the STD. In other words, the 50th percentile is assumed to be the same as the mean and the mean is used as the estimate for the 50th percentile. The STD is a mea-sure of the spread of the sample around the mean and is calculated as the square root of the variance. If the true population distribution is normal, then the mean plus one STD would be the 84th percentile. The mean plus 1.645 STDs would be the 95th percentile. If raw data are not available, this is a method for estimating the percentile value for a par -\nticular individual and we will provide some examples and instructions on how to do this.\nSummary statistics (or aggregate data) can be acceptable to use for the start -\ning sample but raw data are better. Summary statistics can be useful to get an idea about where a person falls with respect to others in the population. However, they are 1D and do not capture the relationship between measurements. For wearables, these relationships are very important. In addition, aggregate data only describe the sample in one way, the way the person calculating them wanted. So, it might be the wrong age group or the wrong mix of subjects. For example, in the CAESAR report on U.S. population ( Harrison & Robinette, 2002 ), the summary statistics from the \nCAESAR survey were weighted to match the stature and weight distribution of the U.S. population from the 2000 census. This summary of the data may be out of date. According to the National Centers for Health Statistics (NCHS) since the year 2000, the population has become more obese ( Fryar et al., 2018 ). Also, our TP may be \nyounger than this sample which includes people ages 18\u201364.\nOn the other hand, with raw data, it is possible to reanalyze and match a more \nrecent population. Raw data (like that in Appendix A) can be edited, re-analyzed, relationships can be explored, and the sample can be weighted or reconfigured to better reflect the composition of the new product\u2019s TP. Some raw data is available from the internet such as the WEAR Association ( www.bodysizeshape.com ) or you \ncan collect your own. We will describe how both aggregate data and raw data can be used to select or evaluate cases and get the design started in Chapter 3 .\npLann Ing FuLL tp s amp Le\nThe primary purpose of the full TP sample is to serve as a representative sample for \nanthropometry and demographics, against which we will map the fit ranges, evaluate population accommodation, and evaluate the cost versus benefit of size assortments.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3537, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8e41207-d3b5-4c09-b509-1816bb582381": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8e41207-d3b5-4c09-b509-1816bb582381", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ab4c5f9d-8428-490b-982d-c73f30860e2e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "78", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "09059982b19c764bdcbe250c5d36ffa800471e5d58c2320fee7c2a4b1ab7497a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "78 Product Fit and Sizing\nWe will also use it to determine how many of each size to produce. Therefore, the full \nTP sample must be raw data that can be segmented (have some subjects dropped), weighted (give some subjects more representation and some subjects less representa -\ntion), and re-analyzed and visualized (graphed).\nWhen compiling a full TP sample, we want our results and sizing estimates \nto be close to the truth, but we don\u2019t want to spend too much money or too much time. More is not always better. What we want is a happy medium. To achieve this, we need to examine two things: (1) size range coverage and (2) precision of mean values.\nWe don\u2019t know the size range or the range of fit in a size before we start, but \nwe can see the impact of sample size with hypothetical size ranges. An example is shown in Figure 2.17 . Here we show stature and weight for males with three different \nsample sizes, 1122, 250, and 100 subjects. Overlaid on the plot of their measurements are 11 sizes, three height and six weight sizes and these cover ranges from 1600 to 1900 mm in stature and 50 to 100 kg in weight.\nWe see that with 250 subjects, we have a substantial number of subjects in each \nof the sizes but with only 100 subjects, some of the sizes are nearly empty. Clearly, 100 subjects are not enough to represent the spread of male subjects but 250 subjects might be if 250 is also enough to ensure we get a sufficient precision of the important and relevant measurement mean values. The mean values represent where the size ranges will begin and be centered. Evaluating the distribution of the mean is the most common method for estimating sample size.\nWe showed two historical examples of sample size estimates above, one that \nestimated 250 for each gender with 500 total and another with more subgroups and a total of more than 2500. Both used estimates of measurement means and both are good estimates. The larger sample cost more to produce but had less risk that one or more of the subgroups would be underrepresented because subgroup means were evaluated. The best way to approach planning for the full TP sample is to evaluate the risk for important and relevant measurement means given different sample sizes and use this to make an informed decision about cost versus benefit.\nFor evaluating anthropometric mean accuracy versus sample size, the SEM is the \nstatistic used. The STD of a statistic, such as the mean, is referred to as the statistic\u2019s SE. The SEM estimates the distribution of the mean and the STD of the measure -\nment estimates the distribution of the measurement. These are two different distri -\nbutions, with the distribution of the mean having a smaller range, see Figure 2.18 .\nWe know from the central limit theorem (CLT) that the distribution of the sample \nmean is normal with the mean (i.e., the mean of the means) being the true mean and the STD being the SEM. This is true no matter what the distribution of the original vari -\nable is. Therefore, we can use the SEM to estimate how close we are likely to be to the true mean. This is referred to as the confidence we have regarding our sample mean.\nWe denote the SEM as \u03c3\nX and it is calculated as follows:\n \u03c3=\u03c3\nnX", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3218, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "12d236bb-7b8f-47f1-97f2-5f27524c0d77": {"__data__": {"id_": "12d236bb-7b8f-47f1-97f2-5f27524c0d77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4b716599-780d-459e-8a5d-784be339d3d4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "be9828cc8bfcc336094085028fbd85248ec280d3fd0c8ed99fbafbcd143f4ed0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "79 Inputs and Getting Started\nFIGURE 2.17  Sample sizes versus hypothetical size range coverage.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 96, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2367cacf-02b5-4e81-9661-bc6c1234569b": {"__data__": {"id_": "2367cacf-02b5-4e81-9661-bc6c1234569b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "871ecb84-4d2d-468e-b76b-6171192fd182", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "80", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "555e41d9bdfea6c9d28563cafb43697b2afcfad38e5196cb6e5840dadb824431", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "80 Product Fit and Sizing\nwhere \u03c3 is the STD of the measurement, and n is the sample size.

For example, n is the hypothetical sample size, \nwhereas N is actual sample size, \u03c3 is the true standard deviation which is unknown, \nand STD is the estimated standard deviation from the sample.\nChurchill and McConville (1976) used the size of \u03c3X for 187 different measure -\nments to arrive at the sample size of 250. They found that most of the 187 mea -\nsurements would have a \u03c3X with a size that was within their tolerable error with \n250 subjects. They did not estimate the confidence for the means within ethnic or age subgroups. This is where they assumed some representation and accuracy risk because the within-group values would be much larger given the sample size within the groups would be much smaller than 250.\nIn contrast, for the CAESAR\u2122 project ( Robinette et al., 2002 ) confidence ranges \nwere estimated for just one measurement, stature, but the confidence levels within racial and age subgroups were also examined. This required more subjects, time, and cost overall, but had less risk that any of the subgroups would be under-represented or inaccurate. The two methods also had different ways to set the amount of tolerable error. Churchill and McConville set the error as a percentage of the mean values and arrived at n = 250 because more than 90% of the 187 variables were within the toler -\nable error.

This sample had less risk but at a higher cost.\nBoth methods are valid and reasonable, but for our product, we need to assess \nsample size using measurements and tolerance ranges that relate to the amount of manufacturing or sizing error our product can tolerate. The best way to estimate \nsample size is to use a variety of estimates and weigh benefit, risk, and cost to make an informed decision.\nTo estimate the number of subjects, we need to know (or estimate) three things: \n(1) the measurements that need to be accurate, (2) the amount of accuracy they need to have, and (3) the \u03c3, of the measurements in our TP. We need some prior data \nto estimate the \u03c3 values. Usually, we do not have prior data on the exact variable \nwe think is most important and sometimes we do not know which variable is most important either. Therefore, looking at a selection of variables can help.\nThe most used sample size estimation formula is the one for a simple random \nsample of one continuous variable. This formula is:\n =\u03c3nz e/22 2\nwhere n is the sample size, e is the amount of error we are willing to accept (called \ntolerable error), \u03c3 is the estimated standard deviation for the measurement we are \nusing to estimate the sample size, and z is the normal deviate or z score for confi -\ndence level we want to use. The z score is the distance from the mean expressed in \u03c3X \nunits and the confidence level or confidence percentage is the area under the normal curve (the z distribution) at that z score distance. For example, for 95% confidence that the true mean will be within our tolerance of the sample mean we want the z score to be 1.96 or greater. These values can be found in normal distribution tables or using online calculators.\nTo use the sample size formula, we must choose the measurement we want to use, \nthe amount of error we are willing to accept, and the level of confidence we want to have, for example, 90% confidence or 95% confidence, and we must also estimate the standard deviation ( \u03c3). This is what was done for the CAESAR project ( Robinette et al., \n2002 ). Stature was chosen as the measurement, 10 mm was selected as the amount of \nerror we would tolerate within a subgroup, 95% was selected as our confidence level, and a within-group STD for stature was estimated at 70 mm as shown in Table 2.16 .\nThe equation becomes:\n ==n1.96 70\n1018822\n2\nTABLE 2.16\nValues for Estimating Within Subgroup Sample Size\n\u03c3 \u03c32\u03c3X Tolerable Error z Confidence Level n\nStature (mm) 70 4900 4.95 10 1.96 95% 188", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2653, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0535feff-fd37-4f50-b534-cec442df6f02": {"__data__": {"id_": "0535feff-fd37-4f50-b534-cec442df6f02", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a248d36c-34cd-4cbf-a610-09ec8ef5a2b3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "82", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "31676dc8632e31e796e576166e2b4f05d784a9ef6b1cf3e8598bbc89a6e884ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "82 Product Fit and Sizing\nThe issue is that we do not always know what measurements or confidence levels \nwe want to use or what tolerances we are willing to accept. So, it is helpful to look \nat some options like multiple variables, and multiple tolerances, and to decide how much risk is acceptable. An example of this is shown in Table 2.17  a and b. This \nexample is essentially a combination of the Churchill and McConville method and the CAESAR method. Here we compare results for four measurements, two levels of tolerable error and two sample sizes, n = 200 and n = 50 for the male sample. We see that at n = 200 with the larger tolerance, our confidence levels are more than 99% and with n = 50 the confidence levels are all over 93%. If these are our most impor -\ntant measurements and the larger tolerances are acceptable adding 150 subjects only improved our confidence in the accuracy of the means for the two genders by 6%, so a sample size of 50 is reasonable.\nIn contrast, at the small tolerance level, there is a more dramatic difference in \nour confidence levels with the two sample sizes. With n = 200, our confidence levels are all over 90% and all but one over 95%; however, with n = 50, confidence levels drop to less than 70% in some cases. Note that in this example the small tolerance confidence levels with 200 subjects are equivalent to the large tolerance confidence levels with 50 subjects. This illustrates that increasing the sample size increases the precision of the estimate.\nBased on this evaluation, we might decide to start with n = 50 for each gender \ngroup and check with our actual data to see how confident we can be that our group is well represented. If not, we could decide to add more subjects at that time. Or we might decide to plan for some value between 50 and 250 as a compromise.\nA sample size of 30 is often used in statistics as a minimum number per subgroup. \nThe reason for this is that this is the number at which the distribution of the mean can be estimated using the standard normal distribution (z) rather than the student\u2019s T distribution. It is thought of as the point at which the mean estimate become stable or minimally reliable.\nAs noted in Table 2.11 , there are three sources for the final sample: (1) the starting \nsample if it is raw data, (2) fit test samples, and (3) a new large sample collected. The full TP sample is often a combination of the three and it is important to have a plan for the sample before data collection begins to make the best of the resources available.\nPlanning consists of:\n1. Defining subgroups to be sampled\n2. Estimating sample size desired in each subgroup\n3. Determining the sources for the subjects (new sample vs fit test samples, etc.)\n4. Planning for combining samples, if needed\nSometimes we start with a small sample, and after an assessment, we determine \nwe need to add more subjects. This might be subjects of a particular size, or from some group that we feel needs more representation given the initial results. It is important to plan for that possibility. Also, we can build up a large sample over time by combining data from our various tests if we manage the data from our samples well.

This is used if the sample has \nmore representatives from some groups and fewer representatives from other groups than the population. Weighting can also be used to evaluate the cost versus benefit of creating sizes for different populations.\nCompanies with marketing departments have researched to understand their \ncustomers and they characterize their customers\u2019 demographics. These can also be estimated using data from national statistics such as the U.S. Census. With these numbers, the weights can be calculated as shown in Table 2.18 . The estimated TP \ndemographics proportions are divided by the sample demographics proportions to produce the weight values for each category. These can then be applied to create a weighted sample. For example, each Asian male in our example would be given the weight value of .85 and each Asian female, the value of .31. This means when counted in the weighted sample, they would represent .85 people and .31 people, respectively. They represent less than one person in the weighted because our origi -\nnal sample had a greater proportion of Asian males and females than the TP.\nTo create a weighted sample, we first create a variable that contains the weight. In \nSPSS\n\u00ae, this can be done in the Syntax Editor as shown in Figure 2.19 . Then this weight \nis applied to the sample using the \u201cWeight Cases\u201d function shown in Figure 2.20 .

Also, several different weight variables can be created and applied to the sample. This is very useful for evaluating sizing for different TPs. So, for example, we might have one weight variable for the United States and another one for Australia. Or we might have one weight variable for a predominately younger sample and another for a predominantly older sample. This is useful for cost versus benefit analysis (CBA).\nIt is important to note that weighting should not be used if any of the strata or cat -\negories have no one in them. Zero times anything is zero, so the weights do not work. It is also not advisable if there are less than five people in one or more of the categories.\nWHAT CAN GO WRONG?\nNo matter how well we plan, things can still go wrong.

Robinette, Daisy Veitch,  \nand Sandra Alemany\nABSTRACT\nAfter we have all the tools and resources we need, the next step is to create our first \nprototype or mock-up. To do this we need some representation of an individual or individuals around which to design and build it. We call these individuals \u201ccases\u201d. A case can have three forms: (1) a list of measurements of an individual, (2) a three-dimensional (3D) or four-dimensional (4D) model of an individual, or (3) the actual individual. The actual individual is sometimes called a fit model or a live model. This begins with the selection of a case to represent the first size called the base size. Selecting this case effectively gets the design centered on the area of the Target Population (TP) that has the greatest concentration of people. Additional cases are selected to evaluate the potential range of fit. Cases are portrayed in two ways for prototyping products: (1) physical manikins and people or (2) digital manikins. This chapter discusses how to select, model, and use a small number of cases to design, modify, or redesign a product and produce a mock-up or prototype.\nThis chapter deals with the first three steps in the design loop of the Sustainable Product \nEvaluation, Engineering, and Design (SPEED) process design loop (shown again in Figure 3.1 ): (1) selecting and using a case or a set of cases, (2) designing/modifying/\nredesigning the product, and (3) production of prototypes or mock-ups. Some projects have larger budgets and more resources available than others. We organized this chapter to start with the best methods, then we add additional methods to accommodate reduced resources or budgets. We include explanations about the risks and limitations of the different methods so the reader can decide which options work best for their situation.\nWhile a random sample from our Target Population (TP) is a sample of cases \nfor design purposes, it can be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to use the whole sample. Instead, we use a small number of individuals, relevant to the product, selected based upon their body size and shape. For wearables, that have multiple sizes, case selection begins with someone in the middle, where the population is con -\ncentrated, for two or three of our most important variables. The mid-size case repre -\nsents the first size, called the base size. The base size is the foundation of a product\u2019s design and sizing, and a well-selected base size is essential for a good sustainable fit standard. If the base size is in the wrong place the entire sizing system will suffer.\nThe base size case is used to create the first prototype and to evaluate design \nissues and options. It is best if this case is represented by a live model who can don the prototype and provide feedback in the design loop. It can also be represented by other models, such as a manikin or a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model, but only the live model can provide meaningful feedback. Because the model will provide 3\nThis chapter has been made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3149, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f3b2de2-d933-4fe6-be75-0a76007705dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f3b2de2-d933-4fe6-be75-0a76007705dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cbaeb5f6-ac37-4974-b1fb-bebc590d0bf2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "92", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "4ac8277e93c08b910376886a2ee1eb522a09920ca62645a45b9541fe46f38fcd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "92 Product Fit and Sizing\nFIGURE 3.1  SPEED process.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 52, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a42932cd-2bdc-44a7-83a7-6c6c5e64a6c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "a42932cd-2bdc-44a7-83a7-6c6c5e64a6c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e3ea3f5b-d491-4fa1-b9ef-fa02c7cc3593", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "93", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "80517aa212d3c8718b13a26a66be70c38f5ca62cf39a0127cb78d289e78128b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "93 Cases and Fit Models\nfeedback, it can be important that the live model be drawn from the user population \nand be very knowledgeable about how the product should fit. This is particularly true for protective equipment or wearables, where use case experience is an important factor. For example, someone who has experience wearing a helmet will give better feedback about a helmet fit than someone who has never worn one. The experienced wearer will understand how uncomfortable something can become after it is worn for a length of time and will appreciate the benefit of a snug helmet fit over a loose one, even if it is a bit more uncomfortable. Similarly, an experienced police officer who has worn body armor on the job will give better feedback regarding body armor for police officers, than someone in another occupation or who has never worn body armor.\nMost products will require multiple sizes, so the base size is just the start. Design \nloop testing reveals design issues, the range of fit within each size and the measure -\nments that are the best predictors of good fit. These are unknowns or theories before fit testing. When developing a new wearable (as opposed to evaluating an existing one) it is usually most cost-effective to start with one case and one size, then work out all the design and fit issues for the first case and size before adding cases and/or sizes. It is cheaper and faster to fix one prototype than it is to fix many. Also, after testing the first size it may be determined that fewer sizes are needed than originally hypothesized so some of the sizes built are wasted time and material. Even if it is determined more sizes are needed than originally hypothesized it is likely that some of the prototypes built, fall between the sizes needed so they are wasted as well.\nHowever, if we only have one size for testing, we have limited ability to discern \nhow much size overlap we need so we need to test additional sizes in another design loop. If we have a good idea when we start about what additional sizes we need, then testing multiple sizes at the start might save us some time. The good news is that the process for selecting the base size case can also be used to select multiple cases and sizes before fit testing if we choose. It often depends on the maturity of the product and the existing knowledge about how it should fit.\nIf we have predecessor products that we can use for fit testing or already have a \nfit model that we have been using, the case selection process can still be informative. It helps us evaluate our fit model and our test subjects to verify they are well-placed and to confirm a good representation of the TP. This is part of what we refer to as a fit audit and helps establish and sustain an effective fit standard.\nSELECTING CASES\nIt is common for people to assume that if we design for the average person, we will fit most people. This is not true. Averages and percentiles can be very helpful in selecting the individuals to use as cases because they give us a way to understand where a person falls in size compared to everyone else. However, if we build prototypes from averages or percentiles, or 3D models built on averages and percentiles, rather than individual people, it has been illustrated by many scientists that we might not fit anyone ( Dainoff \net al., 2004 ; Daniels, 1952 ; Robinette & Hudson, 2006). It isn\u2019t that averages are bad. It \nis that averages are only relevant to one measurement. When we try to use the average of all measurements, we create an entity that doesn\u2019t exist. An individual person might be average in one measurement, above average for another, and below average for a third.

Subject 1 has narrow shoulders and wide \nhips and subject 2 has wide shoulders and narrow hips. Suppose we are building a \nvest, such as a compression vest or a ballistic vest, and we must cover the torso and fit snuggly. If we use the average of these two individuals for all their torso measure -\nments, we create the average torso, and we see that the average of these two torsos is too small for both. For subject 1 it is too small in the hips and for subject 2 it is too small in the shoulders. Depending on our Concept-of-Fit (COF) it may also be too large for both, but in the opposite areas.\nIn Figure 3.3 , we show a real example of measurements for individuals and their \nrelative size expressed as percentiles.

The percentile range that encloses the middle one-third or 33% is also shown along the y axis. If we follow this range horizontally, we see that all three subjects fall in this middle range for at least one measurement and fall outside this range for at least one measurement. They are all average for some things and not for others. All real people are a mixture of small, medium, and large measurements. No one is average or any given percen -\ntile for all measurements.\nWhile we show just three people here, Daniels (1952) demonstrated that this \nis literally true for everyone if there are more than a few measurements. Daniels demonstrated that out of 4,000 men, none were within the middle one-third for all 15 measurements. Thus, something built around all average values could be either too large or too small for everyone.\nInstead of \u201caverage people\u201d or \u201cpercentile people\u201d that don\u2019t exist we use cases. \nA case is a single individual to be represented in a product design or evaluation \n(Dainoff et al., 2004 ; Zehner et al., 1993 ). A case can have three forms: (1) a list of \nmeasurements of an individual, (2) a three-dimensional (3D) or four-dimensional (4D) model of an individual, or (3) the actual individual. The actual individual is sometimes called a fit model or a live model. If we fit the individual, we know we will accommodate at least one actual person, the case, and probably other people who are similar in size and shape. If we choose our first case wisely, we can accom -\nmodate the greatest number of people from our TP in our first size.\nIn Chapter 2 , we described how to find or collect a suitable sample to represent \nthe TP with relevant variables and demographics. We also described how to tailor the sample if raw data were available. This is the starting TP sample. We use this sample to identify and select cases. The process for selecting cases has three steps:\n1. Identify and select two to three key variables\n2. Evaluate and select cases for the base size\n3. Evaluate and select cases for size range estimation\nSince people are not average for all measurements or large for all measurements, \nwe must decide which measurements are the most important for the product and select two to three of them to guide our case selection and control our sizing. We call these variables key variables . These are variables that are both important to \nthe product and, when used in combination, should control most of the important size variability. They are important for paring down our original set of variables to something manageable and easy to understand. Key variables are used in several ways including:\n1. To select cases\n2. To design a product\n3. To evaluate fit\n4. To predict fit for cost versus benefit analysis\n5.

For products that have predecessors or a history of sizing for \nsimilar products, such as clothing, the manufacturer will typically have a good idea \nabout what the top three key variables are. Things to consider when deciding on key \nvariable combinations are:\n\u2022 How relevant and important are they to the design?\n\u2022 How easy are they for non-experts to measure or use to select a size?\n\u2022 Is there an existing size standard for similar products?\n\u2022 How closely related (or correlated) are they to other measurements?\n\u2022 How much variability in all measurements will be controlled by the key \nvariables?\n\u2022 How well do they predict fit?\nWe begin by examining candidate variables and their relationships. As we prog -\nress through fit testing, we may change the key variables based on a better under -\nstanding of which variables affect fit, fit issues, and sizing.\nAfter we have selected the key variables, we must decide how big or small the \ncandidates should be for the key variables and how close to the desired size is close \nenough. There are a variety of tools that can help.\nFor wearables, it is most cost-effective to start the design with a case in the center \nfor the key variables. Then move out from the center if needed, to create additional \nsizes. There are more people close together in the center than at the edges or bound -\naries of a measurement, so a product designed for a center case will accommodate \nmore people than one designed for a large or a small case. It will also be easier to find \nother people near the case for fit testing.\nIn addition, in the commercial world, it is often not cost-effective to accommo -\ndate the extremes. There are not enough sales to make it feasible to produce and \nstock extreme sizes. The most important area to accommodate is the middle where \nmost people are clustered. One size may not fit all, but it might fit most if it is in the \nmiddle. We refer to that center size as the base size.\nTo estimate the relative size of an observation compared to all other observations, \nand to find the center, we use the frequency distribution . When we count the number \nof times an observation occurs, we are counting its frequency . When we count how \noften all observations occur, we are estimating the frequency distribution . A frequency \ndistribution describes the number of observations for each possible value of a variable. \nA histogram or bar chart is the visual representation of the frequency distribution.\nWhen we estimate the relative size of a measurement, we are estimating how many \nobservations are smaller and how many are larger. When we have many observa -\ntions, this counting can be tedious and time-consuming. Luckily, mathematicians and \nstatisticians have provided us with estimates of common frequency distributions that \nenable us to avoid having to count, if we think it is reasonable to assume that our data \nfollows one of the common distributions. The most common frequency distribution \nis the Gaussian distribution which is also called the Normal distribution. (Normal is \nthe name of the distribution.

The Normal distribution is a symmetric distribution that is \nshaped like a bell with a peak in the middle, as shown at the top of Figure 3.4 .\nThree different statistics indicate a middle point: the mean, the median, and the \nmode. Usually, when someone refers to the average, they are referring to the mean that is estimated by the sum of all observations divided by the number of observa -\ntions. The median is the 50th percentile. It is the point at which half of the observa-tions (50%) are smaller and half are larger. The mode is the peak of the observations\u2019 frequency distribution and is the point around which most are clustered.\nIn the true Normal distribution, all three of these middle points (mean, median, and \nmode), are the same value. In the real world, these three values are usually different. For example, if some observations are very large and are not balanced by very small ones, it can pull the mean away from the mode and the median to the right or to the large side. This type of distribution is said to be skewed to the right and an example is shown at the bottom in Figure 3.4 . This is common for Weight and related variables, such as Waist \nCircumference, but less common for Stature and height variables. A distribution can also be skewed to the left, but that is less common for anthropometric variables.\nThe median is technically the actual middle, since half are below, and half are above. \nHowever, there can be fewer people clustered around the median than around the mode. The mode is the point where there is the greatest concentration of people. The mode is the easiest to visualize from a distribution plot. The mode, being the greatest concentra-tion of people, is the best point for the base size.

The median is usually close to the \nmode for anthropometric variables, so it is a good second choice when raw data and the frequency plot are not available. The mean is good as the third choice.\nThe distribution for one variable is referred to as the univariate  distribution. The \ndistribution for two variables is called the bivariate  distribution. The distribution for \nmany variables is called the multivariate  distribution. The two variable frequency \ncan be visualized in a two-dimensional scatterplot we call the bivariate distribution plot or more simply, the bivariate plot. If we have two key variables their bivariate plot helps us visualize the bivariate mean, median, and mode and the relationship between the variables. If there are three key variables it can be difficult to visualize the trivariate plot because it is 3D. However, we can view the three bivariate plot combinations, variable 1 by variable 2, variable 1 by variable 3, and variable 2 by variable 3, provided we have the raw data to create the plots.\nHigher dimensional multivariate distributions are more complicated to visual -\nize. Fortunately, because many anthropometric variables are correlated, we typically don\u2019t need more than three to select cases.\nIn Chapter 2 , we discussed some differences between having raw data versus aggre -\ngate data from a sample. Raw data is the sample itself, while aggregate data is only a description of the sample. Therefore, aggregate data is also referred to as descriptive statistics. If we have raw data, we can calculate aggregate data but with aggregate data, we cannot completely reconstruct the raw data.

More is not always better. A good rule of thumb is, \u201cWhen in doubt \nleave it out\u201d. For example, Stature and Weight are nice variables for tailoring the TP \nsample, but they are not directly relevant or important for headgear or footwear case \nselection. Leave them out during case selection for those products. Use measure -\nments that will directly relate to the size of the product such as Head Circumference \nfor headgear or Foot Length for footwear.\nThe process of selecting key variables for case selection is a variable reduction \nprocess. The goal is to pare down the list of variables to two or three that control \nmost of the important size variability.\nIf there are measurements that are directly relevant, but maybe not very important \nto control, they can be kept for the case selection analysis, but be given low priority \nfor key variables. This might include things that we know will be accommodated \nwith some adjustable features like a strap, but we want to keep an eye on them.\nIf, after eliminating all the measurements from our sample that are not directly \nrelevant or are not important to control, we have just two or three left, those become \nour key variables. No need to pare down further because it is relatively easy to exam -\nine their combined relationships to select cases.\nIf, however, we have more than three relevant and important variables we need \nto study their relationships to pare them down further. The best way to do this is to \nselect two or three that, when combined, will have a strong relationship with all the \nother important variables. A strong relationship between two variables indicates that \none would be a good predictor of the other and if we control one, we will control a \nlarge part of the other. A weak relationship between two variables means they repre -\nsent and control different aspects of size or shape variability.\nWe get a stronger combined control over all the variables if we select two weakly \nrelated variables to be key variables, rather than two variables that are strongly related. \nIf the key variables are strongly related, they are representing the same source of size \nvariability, so they are redundant. If, instead, they are weakly related to each other, but \neach is strongly correlated with other variables, we get better overall control. Each of the \ntwo variables represents or controls a different group of variables so we can control many \naspects of size with just two variables. For example, Hip Circumference and Inseam \nLength are a better combination than Hip Circumference and Waist Circumference. The \nformer set is not correlated with each other, but each is strongly correlated with other \nmeasurements. The latter are strongly correlated with each other and do not relate to any \nheight or length variables. Therefore, we get more control with the first combination.\nCompanies that have a long history of product development or many existing \nproducts may have a good idea about what good key variables might be. Even for \nthese companies it can be helpful to go through the process of examining relation -\nships between variables to increase the understanding of just what is controlled by \nthese variables and what is not. They may find that while the key variables they have \nbeen using are good, there are even better ones out there.\nWhen we have raw data, we can calculate new statistics and create new plots \nto understand and represent relationships between variables including the anthro -\npometric measurements.

In other words, it indicates whether if one variable gets larger the \nother variable gets larger as well. The deviation is measured using the variance for each variable, which is the squared standard deviation (Std. Dev.).\nSince covariance is the measure of relationship in the original units of measure, \na larger measurement, such as Stature, and a smaller measurement, such as Hand Length, would both have variances and covariances in millimeters squared. With covariance, a 10 mm change in Hand Length is treated the same as a 10 mm change in Stature when in reality a 10 mm change in Hand Length is a much bigger part of the total range of variability in the Hand than a 10 mm change in Stature. As a result, it can be difficult to understand the relationship by just looking at the covariance. Therefore, we use standardized variables and a standardized covariance which is called the correlation  and is denoted as r or R.\nStandardized variables are created from the original variables by first subtract -\ning the mean from each value and then dividing by the Std. Dev. This removes the magnitude of the original variable so we can examine the relative change in one vari -\nable given the change in the other on a variability scale rather than an original unit\u2019s scale. The new value for each observation is a standardized value expressed as a Std. Dev. unit rather than the original units of measure. The mean of the standardized version of each variable becomes 0 and the Std. Dev. becomes 1. The covariance of the standardized variables is the correlation.\nThe correlation has a value between \u20131 and 1. Negative correlations indicate that \nas one gets larger the other gets smaller. Positive correlations mean as one gets larger the other gets larger as well. A zero correlation indicates one variable has no effect on the other, and this is called independence .\nThe correlation between two variables is called a bivariate correlation . Bivariate \ncorrelations between multiple variables are usually expressed in a table called a cor -\nrelation matrix.  A matrix in mathematics is a set of numbers arranged in rows and \ncolumns.\nFor example, we chose eight measurements we felt were relevant to a headgear \nproduct that will have a display and an attached mask or mouthpiece.

This means that even though correlated the cor -\nrelation is too weak to be meaningful.\nIn contrast, the correlation between Head Length and Head Circumference is \n0.788 and this R2 is 0.621 (62.1%). This means 62% of Head Circumference is con-\ntrolled by Head Length and vice versa. In other words, as Head Length gets larger, Head Circumference does too, so the amount of variability remaining for Head Circumference at any given Head Length is only 37.9% of the full range. Figure 3.6  \nis a plot of all the subjects in the raw data set (the dots). The line down the center is the best-fit linear regression line for predicting Head Circumference from Head Length. It represents the most likely value for Head Circumference at each Head Length and each point on the line is a mean value called the regression mean .\nThe other two lines are the 95% confidence lines showing the estimated range \nthat 95% of the time will contain the Head Circumference at a given Head Length. The spread of Head Circumference points at any given Head Length value is smaller than the full Head Circumference range. The full range of Head Circumferences goes from 525 mm at the bottom left to 638 mm at the upper right. This is a range of 113 mm. If we look at the Head Circumference variability when Head Length is 200 mm, we see the range of Head Circumferences at this point is from 558 at the bottom 95% confidence line to 598 at the top 95% confidence line. This is a range of 40 mm.

In addition, we have slight control of IPD, although we should treat it as a third key variable since it is also deemed very important.\nThe two variables remaining that are weakly correlated with each of our first two \nkey dimensions are the face length variables. Since they are not critical to our design, we can treat them as if they are independent variables that are not affected by our key variable sizes. In other words, we assume that no matter what the key variable sizes most Face Length values are equally likely. That means we can just examine the uni -\nvariate frequency distribution histograms separately to influence our case selections, just to ensure they are not too extreme.\nBase Size and Base Size Case\nOnce we have our key variables, we begin by finding the target key variable values \nfor our base size case and selecting candidates who have those values. In those instances when we have collected the starting TP sample ourselves, we might already have candidate cases available to us. We can draw them from our sample. Also, some organizations have a subject pool, which is a group of people they can call upon for testing or analysis as needed. However, finding a person to be our case, such as a fit model, often requires recruiting a new person. Whether we already have the person or are recruiting a new one, the process is essentially the same. We start with the key variables\u2019 values to select candidates, then we exam -\nine the rest of their measurements and other factors. Since the key variables are both the most important ones and control most of the other important ones, the candidates selected with the key variables should be good for most things. That means when we are searching for candidates, we do not have to take all their mea -\nsurements unless we choose them as a candidate. This helps us narrow down the possibilities quickly.\nSelecting candidates using raw data has four steps:\n1. Select the key variable sizes for our desired case size\n2. Find and select candidates near this size\n3. Examine them for other measurements and attributes\n4. Choose the best from the candidates\nFor our base size case, we find the middle for our first two key variables, and \nthe best indicator of the middle for selecting cases is the mode. The mode is the center of the peak of the distribution, which is the spot that has the most people. If we use this location, we will accommodate the most people in the first size. The mode is better than the median or the mean, but if the data are not skewed much the mode, median, and mean will all be about the same so medians and means can also be used.\nTo help us locate this spot, we like to use a graph that contains both the univari -\nate histograms for our key variables and their bivariate plots as shown in Figure 3.8 . \nThe bivariate scatter plot is in the middle (with all the dots) and the two univariate", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3122, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00b0e726-c8e6-4450-b2d8-410b28191036": {"__data__": {"id_": "00b0e726-c8e6-4450-b2d8-410b28191036", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "61965e34-23d3-422d-adfc-674e5954a624", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "106", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "eeef29f385a43a03241a80bc252ab3933d922a97749086304e24db9b28956b00", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "106 Product Fit and Sizing\nfrequency plots are on the right side for Head Length and above for Face Breadth. \nThis figure was created by doing two univariate histograms and the bivariate scatter -\nplot separately in SPSS\u00ae, and overlaying them in PowerPoint.

With three key \nvariables, it is best to start with the first two key variables to select a target size and \nlook at the variability of the third key variable at that target size. If the third variable is not correlated or very weakly correlated, we can assume that the distribution of the third variable is the same at any size of the first two variables.

For example, for a pant we might want the circumferences to be in the middle, but we might want a slightly long leg length because the pant leg will be able to be shortened a lot, but not lengthened much. In other words, the adjustability is not symmetric. Similarly, in our headwear example, we might want the IPD to be smaller than the middle if we can widen the IPD adjustment, but not make it narrower. In that case, the accommodation of a narrow IPD in our base size will accommodate the wider ones too. The fifth percentile value for IPD is 58.8 or rounded to the nearest 1 mm equals 59 mm. The 95th percentile for IPD is 77 mm. If we have an asymmetric design accommodation issue, we might want to choose one of these. The point is, when selecting cases, it is important to consider some of the design expectations.\nOnce we have selected our target values for our base size case it is time to recruit \nsomeone to be our case. To find our candidates we have four steps:\n1. Screen people for the key variables\n2. Examine the remaining variables\n3. Throw out any outliers\n4. Look at other important characteristics for which we may not have measurements\nIf we want to start with candidates from our starting TP, we can start by finding \nthose who are close to our target for the first two key variables and then look at the other measurements. If we need to find new candidates (which is often necessary when we are seeking live fit models), we start by measuring candidates for the key dimensions, eliminating anyone who is not within our acceptable range, take the other measurements for candidates who are in range, and examine their variability for the other measurements.\nIf we already have a fit model that we have been using, we should compare his or \nher measurements to the mode at this time. Even if we do not plan to change our fit model it is good to know where he or she falls with respect to our TP before we begin fit assessment for sizing. That will help us understand population accommodation issues and measure the cost versus benefit of keeping this model or replacing him or her with a better one.\nWhen looking at the other measurements it is helpful to use multiple regression \nto predict the non-key variables from our key variables. This provides the prediction confidence range to help us learn if the candidate is an outlier or is a good representa -\ntive for the other measurements as well.\nMultiple regression procedures can be done in Excel\nTM, but it is not as easy as it \nis in SPSS\u00ae.

This gives us five regression equations, one for each of the non-key variables. The non-key variable is the dependent variable, also called the predicted variable and the key variables are the independent variables, also called the predictor vari -\nables. The equations are:\nHead Circumference = 96.253 + 0.981 * Face Breadth + 1.688 * Head Length +  \n0.052 * IPD\nHead Breadth = 70.942 + 0.636 * Face Breadth \u2013 0.032 * Head Length \u2013 0.009 * IPD\nBitragion Breadth = 19.166 + 0.885 * Face Breadth + 0.027 * Head Length \u2013 \n0.016 * IPD\nFace Length = 30.60 +  0.161 * Face Breadth +  0.319 * Head Length + 0.062 * IPD\nSellion-Supramenton = 54.867 \u2013 0.052 * Face Breadth + 0.159 * Head Length +  \n0.304 * IPD\nEntering our cases\u2019 Face Breadth, Head Length, and IPD into these equations \nwe get the predicted values shown in Table 3.5  for the other five variables.

The predicted values are different than the actual measurements for our cases, but that only indicates they are smaller or larger than the predicted mean for that variable. For Head Circumference, Head Breadth, and Bitragion Breadth we see that the predicted values for our two cases and our target input are all the same.

The Head Circumference plot looks nearly identical to the previous \nHead Circumference plot in Figure 3.11  because although we added IPD to the pre -\ndictor variables (independent variables) IPD has only a weak correlation with Head Circumference, so it had little impact on the outcome.\nFigure 3.13  shows the location of the actual Head Circumference values for our \ntwo cases versus their predicted values. Also shown are the regression mean line (the center line) and the 95% CI for the prediction. The predicted values are the expected values (the regression mean values) given the values for the three input (independent) variables. The 95% CI tells us the estimated range of values around the regression mean that will include 95% of the population.\nIn the Head Circumference plot we see that the predicted values for both cases \nand the target, (indicated with an arrow saying \u201call three\u201d) are all the same. However, the actual values for the two cases, indicated with a circle and a square, are a bit dif -\nferent. Case 490 is 3 mm smaller than the regression mean and case 1088 is 4 mm larger. For a large measurement like Head Circumference, with a 115 mm range, these are small differences, and we can see that both are in the cluster of subjects in the center. Therefore, they are not unusual outliers, and both should be good cases for Head Circumference. We might prefer 1088 if being a little bit larger might be expected to accommodate the smaller people.\nThe plot of Head Breadth is the next and shown in Figure 3.14 .

Therefore, these differences will not be significant. Both \nare good representatives for this measurement as well.\nThe last two measurements were not strongly correlated with the key variables, \nbut we were less concerned about accommodating them. For weakly correlated vari -\nables we could have just looked at the univariate frequency plot, just as we did for IPD. However, the regression plots are also helpful and sometimes it is easiest to just do the same plots for everything. The plot for Face Length (see Figure 3.16 ) shows \nour cases are again in the sweet spot in the middle of our distribution. The actual values are just 2 mm smaller for case 490 and 2 mm larger for case 1088. Case 1088\u2019s predicted value is the same as our target input predicted value and this case is more centered in the cluster of subjects. However, both cases have reasonable Face Lengths. They are not extreme outliers.\nFor Sellion-Supramenton (see Figure 3.17 ) Case 490 is just 2 mm larger than the \npredicted value, but case 1088 is 5 mm smaller. While this size is not as close to the predicted as the other variables, it is not out in the fringes near the 95% CI either so we would not consider it an outlier. Statistics help us make informed decisions. However, we still must make the final decision based on a judgment call which may well be dependent on the features of the product.\nIn summary, both of our first two cases have good measurements. The decision about \nwhich case to use must balance measurements, demographics, and conformity to the perception of the target market or fit intention. Some of these things are not adequately captured by measurements alone. For example, the candidate might have an odd bump or oddly shaped feature that is best discovered visually.

The product will not perfectly match the \nbody measurements and the methods to accommodate the body will vary depending on the way the product will be worn and what aspects are rigid, flexible, tolerant, or adjustable.\nBefore selecting cases, it is important to look at them visually for things that our \nminds can understand but can\u2019t always capture with a measurement. These are things like surface smoothness, asymmetry, unusual contours, etc.\nSymmetry is important, so it is a good thing to check before selecting a case. If \nscanning is not an option, then taking some additional measurements on both sides of the body might help. Everyone is somewhat asymmetric. Our hearts tend to be on the left side of the body and most of us have a dominant hand, dominant eye, and dominant ear, all of which contribute to asymmetry. Therefore, asymmetry cannot be avoided, but it is good to try to select someone who has minimal asymmetry.\nIn the 1980s we were told a story, that we have reason to believe was true, about \na man who invented a new kind of lower body anti-gravity (g) suit that was dramati -\ncally improving his ability to withstand high gravity forces.

Averaging is not advised and not helpful. Whether we \nare taking an average of a whole sample or an average of a few individuals, the result is the same. As shown in Figure 3.2 , the average will represent no one, it will smooth \naw \nay important details, and end up the wrong size and shape.\nMultiple Cases\nThus far in this chapter, we have discussed how to get started with the base size and \nthe base size case. This enables us to produce our first mock-ups and prototypes to begin the design loop testing. Fit testing in the design loop is using a Systems Engineering approach to product development and is the ideal way to build a new product. It allows us to evaluate the product\u2019s properties and form factors as we design it using the human as part of the system which enables us to produce the best designs for the wearers. It reveals the measurements that are the best predictors of good fit to serve as key variables (these can be different from the variables we started with), as well as the range of fit within the base size. This information indicates the additional sizes and/or cases we might need. This testing and sizing analysis is the subject of Chapter 4 .\nSelecting multiple cases for predetermining the sizes before fit testing is the \nsource of most of the problems with sizing today. Unfortunately, in the real world, our customers may insist we create products in multiple sizes before doing any fit testing. There is a common misperception that if we just analyze the anthropometry and put it into a magic analysis box out will poof our sizes. We know anthropometry is not enough and people do not come in discrete sizes. The product enforces the sizes. However, we must please our customers if we want to stay in business, so it is important to have a plan for arriving at additional sizes without fit testing. Yes, it may waste time and money, but sometimes letting the customer make the mistake allows us to illustrate the improved process for the next product or iteration.\nThere are a few other reasons why we might want some additional cases before \nwe move to the design loop. Sometimes, we want a few extra cases to use to examine our design concept digitally before we build our first mock-up or prototype and start the fit testing. They can help us get an idea about the fit of the base size on other body sizes before we produce our first prototypes to help us narrow down our design options. We may also want a few extra live cases for our first pilot test and want to choose them wisely.\nThere are two methods for selecting additional cases: (1) grading and (2) distrib -\nuting. Both methods use the key variables we selected. Grading scales the base size case up and down along a line. Distributing selects new cases spread throughout the key variable distribution. Examples of each method are shown in Figure 3.20 .\nThe grading method is the one used in the apparel industry for creating additional \nsizes in mass-produced products. It is implemented in the product by modifying the base size pattern from size to size rather than by creating a completely new pattern for each size. The grades are scaling amounts to move from one size to the next, and they are part of the fit standard.\nThe grading method is cost-effective for sewn products and maybe for other types \nof products as well for several reasons.

By contrast, if each size is produced from a different case, there can be different fit issues for each size that are not related to the sizing but simply because a different person was selected to produce it. Therefore, fixing proportioning or adjustment mechanisms must be done differently for each size which costs more and takes more time.\nWhat has been missing in the apparel industry is the evaluation in the design \nand sizing loops to ensure the product is fitting who it is supposed to fit, the way it is supposed to fit, the size range is accommodating the TP, and with minimal size overlap or waste. Sizing loop testing will also indicate if more than one size range, with a separate base size and grade, is needed. Therefore, for effective and sustain-able sizing, we must do design and sizing loop testing before determining the sizes or finalizing our fit standard. Before the design loop, we may use grading to select additional cases to help in the building of the first prototypes, but it is unwise to predetermine the sizes.\nThere are two types of grades: a body grade and a product grade. The body grade  \nis a chart of scaled body measurements, starting with the measurements for the base size case. The product grade  is a chart of scaled product measurements. These are \nnot the same. Before we get to the design loop, we do not have a product so the grade we are using for selecting cases is the body grade.\nInstead of scaling our base size, distributed cases are completely new cases, cho -\nsen in much the same way as the base size case. A distributed method is sometimes used for fit testing, because it spreads out the test subjects better than a simple ran -\ndom sample. There are many ways to distribute the selection of test cases. The two most common are: (1) to evenly space the cases throughout the range and (2) to use sample stratification.

For some new products, for which we do not have \na sizing history, selecting cases in a distributed way can help us learn how to adapt the product to accommodate the TP, whether that be by adding adjustability or by creating additional sizes.\nWe might also use a combination of grading and distributing cases, where we \nselect completely new cases, but along a grade line. This might be necessary to get a good 3D digital model for use in examining the base size in CAD.\nSometimes knowing the key variable sizes is enough for selecting cases for our \npredesign loop evaluation. However, we often want to know the other body measure -\nments. If, for example, the product has sensors or features that need to be in precise locations with respect to the body, it is good to check the other measurements. We use the regression equations and estimate the additional measurements from the key variables, just as we did for the base size. The only difference is key variable input values.\nContinuing with our headwear example, if we use the cases identified in Figure 3.20  \nwe get the sets of cases shown in Table 3.7 . We used the cases from the Face Breadth \nby Head Length bivariate chart along with the IPD mode as input to the regression equations for the other variables.\nThe output is the regression mean for each variable. We can use these values \nor select subjects who are near them to be the cases we use. Selecting a subject is advisable for most situations, such as if a 3D model is desired for CAD visualiza-tion. The mean values should add together, but this is an average that works just like the overall average. As shown in Figure 3.2 , the average shape may not be like \nanyone\u2019s and may be too small for everyone in some way. Perhaps it will not be a large amount and will still work, but we cannot know without testing. In addition, for some measurements, we may want the case to be smaller or larger than the mean, and this difference affects other measurements. If we use values other than the mean without selecting a person with those values, the case may have body measurements that do not fit together.

We select \nthe cases at these new key variable points the same way we selected them for the base size case.\nFor the graded cases the cases are usually listed as grade rules, which indicate the \nchange from size to size starting with the base size, as shown in Table 3.8 . Here we \nsee the base size case in the middle with the smaller case to the left and the larger case to the right.\nHow many cases should be chosen and where should we place them? We do not \nknow. At this stage, they are guesses or theories, perhaps educated guesses, but still un-tested. This is the reason we need design and sizing loops to determine the sizes. It would be just as reasonable at this stage to select a range of Face Breadth values and keep both Head Length and IPD at their mode values. Regardless of the method used to select cases, it is best if the fit assessment is done with live people cases before any designs or sizes are finalized. A CAD or virtual case assessment is not real. Virtual models are never uncomfortable and cannot move or use the product, the lack of real user feedback that can lead one down a rabbit hole of mistakes.\nThis is a Systems Engineering approach and we must consider the human wearer \nto be part of the system. When we evaluate the cost, schedule, and quality within the trade-off space, we must use the wearer to provide quality feedback to arrive at a cost-effective, good-quality product.\nThe good news is, at this point we are only selecting additional cases to help us \njudge our design concept before we build or modify our mock-ups and prototypes. Therefore, the number and location of cases are not too critical.\nSome engineering and design guides propose using boundary cases. Boundary \ncases  are cases at the extreme edges (boundary) that we wish to accommodate. This is \na type of distributed case. For one measurement the boundary case is represented by people who have specific percentile values, such as the 5th and 95th percentiles. In two dimensions the boundary is represented by an ellipse that contains a certain percentage of the sample and boundary cases are selected around this ellipse. A 95% ellipse indi -\ncates the area for two dimensions that contains 95% of the observations for those two dimensions. An example using our head key variables is shown in Figure 3.21 .

We refer to this problem as the \u201chole in the donut\u201d, a phrase coined by our friend Keith Hendy (personal communication 1995) because the accommodation or fit range looks like a donut with a hole in the middle.

The total percentage accommodated within this range of fit for the boundary cases is just 8% or about 1% per case on average. In other words, we could accommodate the range of fit for all eight cases and fit nearly no one within the middle 92%. Accommodating these extremes would not be cost-effective. We might not want to produce any sizes out there.

To illustrate we use a simple one-dimensional (1D) example. We \nhave a product that will be adjustable, and we want to know how adjustable to make it to accommodate most people in one size. To increase the adjustment range we will need to add material, adjustment mechanisms, and material strengthening structure. This will add cost, weight (mass), and complexity to the adjustment mechanism. Therefore, a smaller range provides a more effective product than a larger range and as we increase range, we degrade product quality. Therefore, we will refer to the additional range needed as the cost of accommodation.\nTo make an informed decision, we compared the increase in the percentage accom -\nmodated to the increase in the adjustment range needed for a given level of accommoda -\ntion. We began with 80% accommodation, the 10th to the 90th percentile range, as the minimum percentage of our TP accommodated.

The adjustment range increases sharply but the accommodation range \nbarely increases at all. When we increase our accommodation range to 90%, we must \nincrease our adjustment range by 29% or from 25.6 cm of adjustment to 32.9 cm.  \nIf we increase our accommodation range to 98%, we must increase our adjustment \nrange by 82%, from 25.6 to 46.5 cm.

Is an \nadditional 1.8% accommodated worth an additional 59% and 15.3 cm of adjustment \nrange? Will the added range require us to have added pieces for telescoping the \nproduct, adding both weight and construction complexity and decrease the comfort \nand acceptability for the first 98% of the TP? It may be cheaper, easier, and result in \na better quality product if we manufacture the product with two sizes of a component \nrather than trying to make one size fit everyone.\nThis is a simple 1D example. Most sizing issues are multi-dimensional. That \nmeans it is more difficult to assess the impact of using one accommodation range for \nour boundary versus another. This is why we stress doing fit testing to establish the \nrange-of-fit in a single size before deciding on the number of sizes or the amount of \nadjustability needed. There is a quality and monetary cost associated with increasing \nthe range of fit, and the cost is higher per percentage accommodated the farther from \nthe center we go. Fit testing allows us to make informed decisions to achieve the best \ncombination of quality, cost, and population accommodated.\nIn summary, we can use the boundary as a stopping point, but it is best if we start \nwith the middle case and move out from there. This can be done as a random sample, \na selection of distributed cases, or a set of grade rules. However, until we do design \nand sizing loop fit testing, we will not know what the range of fit is for each size so \nwe will not know how many sizes we need or where to place them.\nPCA Alternative for Key Variable Selection\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA)  is a multivariate method to help us understand \ncommon themes among a given set of variables and to determine the extent to which \neach variable in the dataset is associated with a common theme. By themes, we mean \ngroupings of related variables and unrelated variables. Bivariate correlation helped \nus understand the relationships (or themes) between pairs of variables. PCA uses the \ncorrelations (or the covariances) to group the variables into related and unrelated \ncomponents.\nPCA can be useful for some applications if used properly and when its limitations \nare understood. For example, it can be a valuable tool for creating a parameterized \n3D human model database, provided it is done in conjunction with standardized tem -\nplate models, Procrustes alignment of datasets, and uniform data point distributions. \nWe will discuss this application in the section on software tools for prototyping.\nHowever, PCA can be very misleading, difficult to understand, and easy to mis -\nuse, so we don\u2019t generally recommend its use for selecting key variables or cases.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3555, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c2af9bb-66f2-4cca-ad4b-d592c3bbcbc6": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c2af9bb-66f2-4cca-ad4b-d592c3bbcbc6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c854cfb1-b9ee-432c-901f-0481a9013366", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "127", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "41549ff22c84c82eb4be2fca783b406fc08a4079a84d7ef19a9eb90933ffb76d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "127 Cases and Fit Models\nWe present it as an alternative method for key variable selection to demonstrate its \nproper use because many people use it incorrectly and have some misguided notions about its importance. Even when used properly it usually provides no additional benefit over the preferred method presented above for key variable or case selection.\nPCA creates combination variables called components based on the multivariate \ncorrelations of all the input variables. PCA has the same number of components as the original variables, but it groups variables that are jointly correlated and separates them from others with which they are not correlated (independent).\nThe first components contain the variable groupings that explain the most vari -\nability. There is a common misperception that the first components are somehow better than the original variables. The argument is that since the first principal com -\nponent (PC) is the variable combination that explains the most variability in the overall set of variables it is the most important and the best. As Brandon Walker (2019)  explains, \u201c\u2026 the first few components can explain almost all the variance in \nyour data set. I\u2019ve seen other data scientists mistakenly think that this means that \u2026 the first few components are the features that are most important. The only way PCA \nis a valid method of feature selection is if the most important variables are the ones that happen to have the most variation in them. However, this is usually not true \u201d.\nIn fact, if the most variability is due to measurement error or axis system and origin \nlocation inaccuracy, then error can become a large part of the first component. All subsequent components will be influenced by it since they must be independent of the first one. We saw one example of this issue in Chapter 2  when single coordinates \nfor landmarks (x, y, or z) are treated as independent variables. When used separately these coordinates are subject to axis system and orientation definition error, the errors are correlated, and x, y, and z coordinates are dependent on each other, so they are not the independent variables PCA requires. After all, PCA is looking for dependencies (relationships), so if we put dependent variables in, we should get dependent variables out and this can hide the size and shape relationships and themes we are seeking. This renders the analysis useless, or worse. It can encourage people to use components as variables that are irrelevant to body size and shape, to the design and the fit.\nThis is particularly a problem for the head because a small axis system error has a \nlarge effect on the point locations. The origin and axis systems for the head can be in different locations each time a person is measured and there is no effective standard head orientation system as explained by Whitestone and Robinette (1997) .\nAlso, Hudson et al.

In other words, the PCs can dilute the representation of the most \nimportant variables in favor of representation of less important ones.\nPCA is particularly problematic if: (1) measuring errors for different measurements \nare correlated, (2) more of one type of variable is included than other types, (3) there are more measurements from one area of the body than another, (4) many unimportant variables are included, (5) some of the input variables are imprecise but others are very precise, and (6) the input variables are dependent.

There is nothing to tell us what a component is other than a list of numbers. We can \ntheorize about what the numbers represent, and we can make visual representations to try to understand what the components are, but we can never really know.\nPCA can be used for key variables and case selection if done properly and if the \npurpose is to understand which of the independent variables we used as input into PCA are related and which are not. This knowledge can help us find key variable combina-tions from the input variables that control a lot of the size and shape variation.\nEach component is a combination of the original input variables and there are an \nequal number of components as original variables. In other words, if we start with eight variables, we have eight components. The first component, called PC1, is the one that explains the most variability in the full set of variables. The second component, PC2, explains the next greatest amount of variability that is also independent of PC1, and so on. Each component is a combination of all input variables, so to measure someone to get their component value for any component we must measure them for all input vari -\nables. Since we are trying to reduce the number of variables we must measure, this is an undesirable property of the components themselves. So, it is often best to use PCA just to understand the relationships rather than using the components directly.\nThe contribution of each original variable to each component is called its loading \non the component. These loadings are essentially the variables\u2019 correlation with the component. They can be interpreted to understand what variability the component represents, but the interpretations are just a matter of opinion and can be misleading. For example, the first component of a basic, unrotated PCA analysis is often referred to as overall size, but it is not actually overall size, and the unrotated PCA is also not very useful. For anthropometric measurement analysis when the purpose is to under -\nstand themes for key variables, the Varimax rotation is better. This rotation better separates the loadings of the variables, so each variable\u2019s greatest loading falls on different components. This makes the relationships between variable combinations easier to understand and use. With the Varimax rotation, PC1 is still the one that explains the most variability, and all components are still independent of each other.\nTo do a PCA analysis a professional statistics software package is recommended. \nWe use SPSS\n\u00ae here, but most software packages have this capability. The steps to \nperform a PCA analysis in SPSS\u00ae are shown in Figure 3.24 . It is found under the \n\u201cDimension Reduction\u201d tab in the Analysis section. The procedure is called \u201cFactor\u201d which stands for Factor Analysis. This brings up a menu where we select the vari -\nables we want to include. The selection variable box underneath the variable selec -\ntion box can be ignored. Under the rotation tab \u201cVarimax\u201d is selected. Under the scores tab \u201cSave as Variables\u201d and \u201cRegression\u201d are chosen to save the components in the data spreadsheet. This will allow analysis and plotting of the components as variables in the data set.\nWe performed a PCA analysis with Varimax rotation using SPSS\n\u00ae with the \nsame head data used for selecting cases with raw data. The results are shown in Table 3.10 . The table is divided into three parts. In part a. the loadings on the first \nthree components for the first PCA analysis are shown. Part b. shows the loadings on the first three components for the PCA with the Varimax rotation. Part c. shows the proportion and percentage of the variance of all the variables that are explained by each component for both the original and the Varimax rotation.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3818, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "657afb5c-5693-483b-a720-fa235b88a834": {"__data__": {"id_": "657afb5c-5693-483b-a720-fa235b88a834", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "129", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e370b14-ca22-4fd3-845d-2228fcf718be", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "129", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "8450bcc1757a2b433430d66d93cfc7abcd865bbc990a89a3aeb47347dd016653", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "129 Cases and Fit Models\nRegardless of the rotation, the first component PC1, controls the greatest amount \nof variability in the input variables. The second component PC2, controls the next \ngreatest amount that is independent (has zero correlation) with the first. The third controls the next greatest etc. After a certain number of components, the amount of variability controlled becomes unpredictable because all options are equally likely due to random chance. When the analysis reaches this point, it no longer matters what variable combination is chosen. In this example, this occurred after three components.\nThe first component from the original PCA will typically have a PC1 that has \nmoderate to high loading for all variables. It is often referred to as \u201coverall size\u201d, but that is an opinion about variability or error and must not be confused with a body size relevant to the wearable.\nThe original PCA does not help us reduce our variable set. It lumps everything \ntogether and treats all variables as if they are equally valuable. It is better to use a rotation. The Varimax rotation separates the input variables into different compo -\nnents while maintaining the overall variability controlled. In other words, each input variable will be a large part of only one component and will be a small part of all the others. At the same time, the overall variability represented in the meaningful components remains the same.\nPart c also shows a statistic called an eigenvalue. The eigenvalue indicates what \nportion of the overall variance is explained by each component, expressed as the number of variables a component represents. In this instance, there are eight vari -\nables, so there are eight total components, and the total of the eigenvalues = 8. \nFIGURE 3.24  Performing PCA analysis in SPSS\u00ae.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1816, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52f07724-cf62-4852-bd2d-2ce9cfcd7c0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "52f07724-cf62-4852-bd2d-2ce9cfcd7c0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e5132674-01e8-49cd-8ce7-f4a7386f768d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "3d566c6f576047de0ddc0157ee7baa63874e3bdfae471ee57732f004982416ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "130 Product Fit and Sizing\nComponent one (PC1) represents the variance of 3.164 variables or 39.55 percent. \nWhen the eigenvalue is less than 1.0 it is considered unstable and it means the com -\nponent represents less than one variable, therefore any component would have about the same result.

The difference is in the loadings and the percentage of the variance explained by each component.

It does not know the source of the variability, so it \nis a mistake to think that the first PCs are more important than the others.\nWe review the PC components to understand which variables are related and \nwhich are not. This does not tell us which are more important than others. It is nice that the PCA separated the variables out for us, and tells us what measurements vary together, but we must still decide which aspects of variability are important. Just as with bivariate correlations, correlation is not the same as important.\nContinuing with our discussion about down-selecting variables, we may not want \nto use PC2 or Sellion-Supramenton as a key variable. Let us look again at the per -\ncent of variance explained by PC2 versus PC3 in Table 3.9 . It is 22.452 and 22.165, \nrespectively. They are only slightly different. We had two length measurements of the face in our set of eight and they happened to be strongly correlated. That gave them preference to be the second component. That does not mean they are more important than the head measurements. If head variability is more important to our product than lengths of the face, we may want to use PC3 or its strongest loading variable as the second key variable.\nIn addition, if face length variability is not as important as IPD we should drop \nPC2 and its high loading variable Sellion-Supramenton from our key variables and select IPD instead. That would give us three key variables: Face Breadth, Head Length, and IPD. Or, as we did in the bivariate analysis, we can start with the two most important variables and decide if we need a third key variable later.\nThe components (PCs) from PCA are variables and can be used directly as key \nvariables. There is debate about whether to use the highest loading variable or to use the PCs, themselves. We recommend using the highest loading variables rather than the components for several reasons.\nFirst, using the PCs as our key variables is usually impractical. Using the PCs as \nthe key variables makes it more difficult to find new cases because all input variables must be measured to calculate each PC. If we use the original variables as key vari -\nables, we only must measure 2 or 3.\nThe statistics software tool will typically do the calculations for you for the sub -\njects used as input to the analysis. For additional subjects, such as when we look for a new case or recruit someone new, we need to know the equation for calculating the PC. PC equations are found in the component coefficient matrix, which is the list of numbers (coefficients) that must be multiplied by each input variable to calculate each subject\u2019s PC score. An example is shown in Table 3.11 .\nThe full equation for calculating PC1 is:\nPC1 = (0.134 * IPD) + (0.338 * Head Breadth) + (0.058 * Head Circumference) \n+ (\u20130.150 * Head Length) + (0.342 * Bitragion Breadth) + (0.353 * Face \nBreadth) + (\u20130.025 * Face Length) + (\u20130.054 * Sellion-Supramenton)\nTherefore, not only is a PC more difficult to measure but these measurements \nmust be taken precisely as in the original study. This is not only cumbersome for \nfinding new subjects to represent our case, but multiple measurements can introduce multiple measuring errors to the PC calculation.

Decision-makers cannot decide what is important when they do not under -\nstand what they are. The original variables are things they understand.\nThird, PCA does not tell us anything about measurements or variables we did not \nhave available when we did the analysis, and if we use a different set of variables, \nwe will get a different outcome. Sometimes we are missing variables in our sample that we might have liked to have had. If, for example, we had some additional eye width measurements related to IPD to use as input, such as Interocular Breadth and Biocular Breadth, perhaps IPD would have shown up as the first PC.\nIf instead we use the highest loading variables on what we consider to be the most \nimportant components, we arrive at good key variables that are less complicated, and easier to explain to people who are unfamiliar with advanced statistics.\nIn summary, PCA, if used correctly, can help us understand variable relationships \nand themes. However, PCA cannot tell us what is important, is easy to use incor -\nrectly, and can be misleading so if we have a good understanding of the relationships, either from experience or from bivariate correlation analysis PCA is unnecessary and not very useful.\nseLeCtIng Cases WIth aggRegate Data\nIf all that is available about the Starting TP Sample is aggregate data (no individual \ndata), then we have limited options for determining good key variable combina -\ntions. We cannot plot bivariate charts, calculate correlations, or do a PCA analysis. All we typically have are means, Std. Devs., and percentiles. Sometimes univariate frequency charts and the mode might be available, but this is rare. Aggregate data come in the form of a document with summary statistics rather than a spreadsheet of raw data. This means we cannot tailor the sample so our data may be biased, contain some subjects who are not in our TP and be missing others.TABLE 3.11\nComponent Coefficients\nComponent Coefficient Matrix\nComponent\n1 2 3\nIPD (mm) 0.134 0.217 \u20130.100\nHead Breadth (mm) 0.338 \u20130.036 \u20130.050\nHead Circumference (mm) 0.058 \u20130.080 0.492\nHead Length (mm) \u20130.150 \u20130.080 0.618\nBitragion Breadth (mm) 0.342 \u20130.034 \u20130.040\nFace Breadth (mm) 0.353 0.014 \u20130.070\nFace Length (mm) \u20130.025 0.477 0.007\nSellion-Supramenton (mm) \u20130.054 0.570 \u20130.131", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2480, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba70e1da-68c4-4537-95bc-a0caa434f420": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba70e1da-68c4-4537-95bc-a0caa434f420", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "566983c7-b6db-4f7f-9950-6ac5ebe7bb7f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "fd49b7bff64699459512584fab5b18d0ab6582fba0e137780002499feabeb7d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "136 Product Fit and Sizing\nFinally, since we do not have individual data with aggregate data, the cases we \nselect or evaluate are not people who were part of the sample. They must be new sub -\njects we recruit. However, if we make some assumptions, there are still some helpful \ntools available to us to give us some confidence in our case selections.\nWith aggregate data, we have two steps for identifying or evaluating a base size \ncase as with raw data: (1) rank order the variables and (2) select cases.\nThe first step for finding cases with aggregate data is to rank order the measure -\nments available from most to least important for our product. The ordering helps us \nunderstand who is best for the most important [fit features].\nFirst, we sort groupings of measurements, then we select one from each group to \nrepresent the group. This approximates selecting two or three key variables as we do \nwith raw data. We are trying to have two or three highly ranked measurements that \nwe believe are each related to a different group of variables. This should help us find \nmore representative cases. This is done with the product in mind.\nTo illustrate, we used the raw data from our earlier headgear example. Working with \nthe product developer we organized the variables we had available into ranked groups. \nThe developer decided that the most important thing for this product is to get the prod -\nuct positioned well with respect to the eyes. Therefore, IPD was deemed our first most \nimportant measurement. It was the only measurement we had of the eyes, so it is the \nonly measurement in the eye group. Next, the product is expected to be fitted to the \ntop and back of the head, so the head measurements were deemed to be the next most \nimportant group. There will be speakers in our product that must be in the general area \nof the ears so the ear measurement, Bitragion Breadth was deemed next most important. \nThis was the only ear measurement we had so it also represents the ear group.\nWhile the product will have a mouthpiece, the location of it will not be critical \nbecause it does not have to be very close to the mouth. It will have a chin strap so \nface measurements are relevant, but it is expected that the strap will be adjustable \nso the variability of the face measurements will be accommodated with a single-\nsize strap. We will need to know the range of the measurements but do not expect \nthem to need sizes. As a result, we decided the face measurements are the least \nimportant.\nFollowing this logic, we arrived at the following rank ordering of the measure -\nment groups:\n1. Eye Group: IPD\n2. Head Group: Head Circumference, Head Breadth, Head Length\n3. Ear Group: Bitragion Breadth\n4. Face Group: Face Length, Bizygomatic Breadth (Face Breadth), Sellion-  \nSupramenton\nNext, we selected a measurement to represent the measurement groups that \nhave more than one measurement. Since Bitragion Breadth, representing our third \ngroup, is also a type of head breadth, we selected Head Length to represent the \nhead size group. It is less likely to be correlated with Bitragion Breadth than Head \nCircumference or Head Breadth, and more likely to be related to different variables \nthan Bitragion Breadth.

We recruited new subjects to find suitable candidates. We examine each candidate\u2019s measurements to see if they are in the center or are outliers.\nAggregate data usually includes the mean and Std. Dev., and these can be used to \ncalculate standard scores for each measurement. The standard scores are also called z scores. The z distribution is the standard normal distribution and z scores are the measurement values in Std. Dev. units rather than the original units of measure. In other words, they are translations of a subject\u2019s measurements into new variables, the standard score variables, that tell us where each subject falls relative to everyone else in the sample. We examine the z scores to eliminate candidate cases that are outliers or abnormally small or large, or to confirm that our candidates are all reasonable. Then we examine other criteria to look for desirable attributes, such as symmetry or things we see that look odd but for which we have no measurements. Some of these are very subjective.\nThe z-score method assumes the measurements are normally distributed and \nmost anthropometric measurements are well approximated by the standard normal distribution. If two measures have the same z score, then they are estimated to be the same distance away from their means in terms of each measurement\u2019s variability. The z score for the observed measurement is calculated as follows:\n =\u2212\u00b5\n\u03c3zy\nwhere y is the observed measurement value, \u00b5is the mean, and \u03c3is the Std. Dev. \nz = 0 indicates the value is equal to the mean. z = 1 indicates the value is one Std. Dev. larger than the mean. z = \u20131 indicates the value is one Std. Dev. below the mean.\nz scores can be translated into estimates of the percentage above and below the z \nscore, the percentiles. Percentile values can be used instead of z scores, but we prefer z scores for three reasons: (1) we are particularly interested in distance from the cen -\nter rather than the percentage of cases that are a given size or smaller, (2) percentile values estimates can be calculated from z scores if we want them, and (3) z scores provide smaller units of measure near the mean so it is easier to discern differences.\nUnivariate z scores are easy to calculate once we have the mean and Std. Dev. for a \nmeasurement. We use the standardize function in Excel\nTM to calculate the standard-\nized variables. The standardize function uses the subject\u2019s value for the measure -\nment, the mean for that variable, and the Std. Dev. to calculate z. The function as it appears in the cell entry box on the spreadsheet is, \u201c=STANDARDIZE(B8,B2,B3)\u201d, where B8 is the row and column with the subject\u2019s measurement, B2 is the row and column with the mean, and B3 is the row and column with the Std.

They are often \nunsure of their choices but do not know what else to do. In this example, each was chosen because they had at least one measurement that was near the mean. We chose 1M because he had a Face Breadth near the mean. We chose 3M because he had a Head Breadth near the mean.\nIt is important to use the ranges for each gender separately. If we combine them \nthe center might be an area with few people of either gender. Since we cannot view the frequency distributions with only aggregate data we cannot see or measure  \nwhere the concentrations of subjects are located and the mode is not typically reported, so we must use the center of each separate subgroup that is estimated by the mean or median (50th percentile).\nThe means and Std. Devs. for males and females from our starting TP aggregate \ndata are shown in Table 3.12 . When screening subjects we found two, one male \nand one female, who were within the 50% range for our first two variables and we labeled them 1M (the male) and 2F (the female). We also found two who were outside this range that we include for comparison purposes. They are labeled 3M (the male) and 4F (the female). (Note that 1M and 3M are the same cases we used earlier.)\nWe took all eight measurements for these four subjects and the measurements are \nshown in Table 3.13 . We calculated and plotted their z scores and percentile values \nfor each measurement using Excel\nTM (see Figure 3.30 ).\nThe female subjects\u2019 z scores and percentiles are from the female sample statis -\ntics, and the male values are from the male sample statistics. As a result, while a male\u2019s measurement may be larger than a female\u2019s, the percentile value and z score may be smaller. For example, subject 3M\u2019s Head Length is larger than subject 2F\u2019s Head Length, but his percentile value is 28 while her\u2019s is 58.\nWhile the z-score plot and the percentile plot are directly related they each give a \ndifferent perspective. The z score gives a better sense of closeness to the center, and this is what interests us. In the z-score plot, the mean is approximately at the zero point and a negative number indicates the subject is smaller than the mean while a positive number indicates the subject is larger.

As a result, 2F is a much better representative for the female center than 1M is for the male center. If our population was predominantly male, we might choose instead to start with the male case.

Therefore, we want to start with a case from the middle of each group, perform a fit test on a prototype for one, and see if its size range accom -\nmodates the other. In this example, the female case seems to be a better representa -\ntive for her gender than the male for his, so we examined her further.\nBefore deciding on a case, such as our candidate subject 2F, it is important to look \nat them either in person or use photographs or 3D scans to see if there are any oddities that aren\u2019t apparent in the measurements. In this instance, since they are new subjects, we looked at them in person, and we took 3D scans of 2F. We examined the 3D scan using an in-house software tool. Three views of subject 2F are shown in Figure 3.31 .\nSubject 2F appears to be a good candidate for a case.

Even medieval armor had to be fitted as explained in the Forge of Svan blog ( Kuznets, 2018 ):\nAfter all steel elements of the future armor were shaped, forged, and hardened, the next \u2013 and most difficult \u2013 step arrived: gathering all the parts together and adjusting them to fit. This was a very important process, since completed armor should have no gaps, should be comfortable to wear, unrestrictive, and articulated. And the most essential for the knight of the Middle Ages \u2013 his armor should protect him as much as possible during the numerous medieval wars.\nThis custom process with fit testing is still a good way to make wearables for the \nfirst individual case, although we have some additional tools to help, such as CAD, block development, 3D scanning, parameterized 3D databases, and 3D printing. However, it is important to note that a particular wearable is usually a mixture of fit -\nted and non-fitted sections, so the customization process is not as simple as copying the body or body segment. For example, for footwear, it is necessary to create or use a form called a last for the base size case which has areas that match the shape of the foot, such as the heel and the width across the ball of the foot, but other areas that have extra room for comfort and movement. The last is also directly used to form and produce the footwear, so it also must be constructed in such a way that it can be removed from the shoe or boot after it is completed. Some examples of shoe lasts are shown in Figure 3.32 .\nFIGURE 3.32  Wooden shoe lasts.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1849, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ead42afe-21bd-4770-9460-01a0fbbbc7cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "ead42afe-21bd-4770-9460-01a0fbbbc7cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "883b9729-fcc6-4d43-b7f3-8dd75ccaa1a2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "692cf9b8b847ee7553545f39477fec6a07c4528806fe8a284e667dd4d9f95fb1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "144 Product Fit and Sizing\nFor clothing the fitted parts highlight or reveal body shape, while the non-fitted \nsections camouflage and conceal certain body characteristics. For example, empire \nwaist dresses are fitted at the bust but loose below it to disguise the waist and hips, whereas A-line dresses emphasize and minimize the waist while hiding or disguis -\ning hips and thighs. With men\u2019s suits, the shoulders might be made to look broader with padding. The combination of fitted and non-fitted sections along with other constraints must be balanced during design and development. When the balance of textile, functionality, and the look combine as intended on the body, the result is a successful garment.\nThe desired fit appearance and intended functionality of the product are referred \nto as fit intentions . When fit intentions are expressed in a 3D form it is called the \nform factor . Computer models of the product are often used to capture fit intentions \nin a digital form factor. Some shoe or boot lasts can be considered physical form factors when they reflect fit intentions like the shape with a particular heel height. Hat forms, called blocks, often contain the shape of the intended product as well as the head circumference of the wearer. These would be considered form factors as well.\nWhen the form factor is created in wearable physical form it is called a mock-\nup of the product. This might be a model of the product that has been carved in wood, 3D printed, or constructed from 2D fabric pieces and sewn together. The mock-up is something that can be worn and fit assessed so we can get our first feedback on the form factor in a design loop pilot test. This will guide the design process and help us alleviate issues with the design early when it is still inexpen-sive to do so.\nThe first mock-ups are usually physical versions of the product that are not fully \nfunctional and/or not made from the intended materials. A toile version of a gar -\nment or portion of a garment or a 3D printed shape for a mask are two examples. Mock-ups are inexpensive examples used to ensure things will fit together or that a shape or form is a reasonable size and attractive. Evaluating mock-ups on live subjects is a quick way to assess the basic shape or the components (sometimes called the form factor), before spending money on materials. This can reduce waste.\nWhen we progress to fully functional products made from the intended materials, \nwe refer to them as prototypes. Some aspects of fit cannot be assessed until we have a prototype, so it is important to iterate testing with prototypes as well as mock-ups on real people with design and sizing loop fit tests.\nUntil we can produce effective 3D fabrics, we must use 2D patterns for fabric \nproducts. For these items, fit intentions are captured in a 2D pattern called the block or sloper. This is the basic pattern upon which styles are based. An example is shown in Figure 3.33  (Veitch & Davis, 2009 ).

For \nexample, it is often easier and more practical to create the block or form factor to fit \na physical manikin representing the base size case. Physical manikins can have pins inserted or be altered by adding clay or plaster.\nManikins remain static and unchanging, and this makes them easier to fit and \neasier to standardize. The manikin never gets tired or changes posture. This can make it easier to visualize the impact of product changes by superimposing 3D scans of the manikin with and without the product such as in Figure 3.34 .\nAlso, modern rapid prototyping technologies are making it easier than ever to \nproduce quick mock-ups for rapid trade studies. For example, we can now create digital form factors in CAD, 3D print the parts for a mock-up, assemble it, and try it out on ten people all in one day. The beauty of CAD is that once we try it and decide it needs to be changed, we can make the change, try a new version on the same group of people rapidly and keep a record of all the versions and test results. If we have a digital manikin to use in the software tool, we can visualize the product on our case and visualize the changes before we make them. In this way, we have a record of our fit model and all the form factors that worked and did not work for that model and the Concept-of-Fit used for the testing.

This includes sharing digital manikins over \nthe internet for team design with remote team members.\nOn the other hand, manikins are never uncomfortable and can do the impossible. \nManikins do not have opinions, and it is better to find out opinions about the design \nconcept early on rather than have it fail to sell later because the users don\u2019t like some -\nthing about it. For example, a head-mounted display company created a prototype \nthat fit the CAD model well and the display performed well. However, the wearers \ncomplained that they felt like they were in a tunnel and said they would never pur -\nchase something like that because it was too claustrophobic. In other words, covering \nthe sides of the product made the display better but made the product unsellable. This \nwas something the CAD model couldn\u2019t tell us. Because we tested a prototype on \nlive people, we were able to find the problem and fix it early in the design process \nwhile it was still an inexpensive fix.\nAlso, manikins will wear our design concepts in ways that people would never \nwear them and no matter how hard we try to force people to wear the product the way \nit was designed to be worn, often it is simply impossible. Manikins cannot reliably \nassess functional requirements, such as the ability to do tasks in the wearable. For \nexample, although apparel fit is often tested in a standing position with the feet close \ntogether other postures may be important depending on the activities the wearers \nwill undertake. Paramedics must deal with situations where the patient might be on \nthe ground or in a difficult-to-access location and the paramedic might need to squat, \nkneel, bend and lift. Garments for paramedics should be tested on a live fit model \ndoing these kinds of motions and activities.\nA digital manikin can wear a product that is a perfect match to the body and \nlook good but be misleading. It can be impossible to know how close to the body to \nmake the product without using a live person. Skintight might be too tight to allow \nfor movement or comfort, but for compression garments, tighter than skintight is \nneeded. To estimate how close to the body the product measurements should be, \nwe need testing with live subjects. For example, skintight gloves might be good or \nbad depending on the materials and the activities. We might need to feel what we \nare gripping, so tightness is good, but we might also need to have the dexterity to \nperform our tasks and tightness would be bad. It might be good to have tightness on \nthe fingertips, but looseness over the back of the hand. The only way to know is to \ntest on live people. Gloves can be tested using dexterity tests, such as those used for \ntesting Chemical Defense gloves ( Ervin & Robinette, 1987 ; Robinette et al., 1986 ). \nIn these studies, different types of gloves were compared, but the same tests can be \nused to evaluate fit.\nSome software tools permit us to create our mock-ups and prototypes and even do \nsome preliminary theoretical fit evaluations. There continue to be new advances in \nhuman modeling for CAD that can help make the first mock-up or prototypes better. \nFor example, Vital Mechanics Research has created a software tool VitalFit that has \na human model with soft tissue properties, ( https://www.vitalmechanics.com/?page_\nid=242 ). This enables some ability to estimate the amount of tissue compression or \ntightness that might be caused by a garment.

However, the tool has two benefits: (1) it permits a quick and inexpensive \nfirst comparison of design concepts and (2) it permits the tracking and recording of fit assessments on live subjects. In other words, if used in conjunction with fit testing on live subjects it can help the team to visualize and track design issues. The tool can be imported into the Browzwear\n\u2122 CAD tool.\nCAD tools for prototyping products such as eyewear, helmets, and body armor \nsuch as AutoCAD\u00ae can be useful for the same reasons. The fit estimates are not \naccurate enough for the final product, but they can help with the first approxima -\ntion of the product and are useful for tracking and visualizing the live subject fit test results and scans.\nIt is important to select or develop manikins that will have the same fit as the live \nmodel. Achieving this can require manikin evaluation since the perfect manikin will not always have the same measurements as the person. In addition to requiring close fit in some areas and loose in others, the manikins do not have the same physical properties as human beings. They do not have the same soft tissue, bone structure, bendability, etc.\nGood manikins can be as complicated to obtain and use as the wearable products \nthemselves. If using manikins, it is a good idea to document all manikins used, tested, or adapted. This is important for the fit standard and for future manikins we might need for new TPs or fit model changes. We provide some guidance on how to create, evaluate, and select manikins in the next two sections, one on physical mani -\nkins and one on digital manikins.\nphysICaL manIkIns\nA physical manikin is idealized and typically has a fixed pose or set of poses. There \nwill be some areas where its body measurements differ from the live person for good reason. For example, a real person can put their arm at their side and there is a sec -\ntion of body contact between the arm and the body extending from the armpit toward the ground often of at least 10 cm in depth. However, a manikin cannot be built with zero gap between arm manikin and torso, because the armhole of the garment needs to slide into the armpit of the, and there must be a gap to allow this. So, either the side of the body needs to be flattened and shaved down, the arm circumference of the manikin is reduced, or the shoulder widened to move the arm away from the body and create the desired gap. Otherwise, it can make it difficult to put the correct fitting size on the manikin.\nIf the waist of a manikin is the same size as the waist of the garment it may not \nbe possible to fasten the garment at the waist unless the manikin\u2019s waist compresses like the human waist. A head manikin with rigid ears, such as that in Figure 3.35 , \nmay make it impossible to don a helmet.\nTherefore, even though the product would fit the live model perfectly it may not fit \nthe manikin. Sometimes these errors are compensated for when the garment is made by building in ease, such as on the sleeve circumference, or by shaving down parts of the manikin to allow for donning. But sometimes the ease just makes it worse or creates a different problem with the sleeves just ending up too tight or the waist too", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3347, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3cc81aeb-0a7a-4dc4-908a-a0525f6304f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "3cc81aeb-0a7a-4dc4-908a-a0525f6304f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d3f0774-16bb-4d37-af9c-b2aaa3512ade", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "d8ec0f9c442952521cbd4d68b39c2a338bd6f1fafb5fa9e35a03fb1f86872b6a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "149 Cases and Fit Models\nlarge, or the helmet sitting in the wrong position. This is where a live fit model is \nessential. He or she will be able to say if the wearable is hard to don or doff, point out movement restrictions and other comfort constraints.\nThere are also debates about how realistic the manikins need to be. For example, \nthere is a clear argument from industry that a symmetrical manikin is easier to work with and less confusing when dealing with remote supplier chains. However, simpli -\nfying the shape by making it symmetric may also remove a layer of realism. The goal is to have a simplified manikin that is close enough to the real fit model such that if it fits the manikin, it will also fit the real person. There is always a risk that it will not be close enough. This risk is mitigated when we test fit on the fit model and then fit test on others in the fit-testing phase.\nCommercial apparel manikins have improved substantially since the 1990s, and \nthere are companies that produce manikins to represent a specific base size case. However, they still have some limitations. For example, the commercial manikin in Figure 3.36  was built to represent a list of key measurements such as Neck Base \nCircumference, Bust Circumference, Waist Circumference, and Hip Circumference, which are indicated with markings placed on the manikin. However, as is true for many commercial manikins these measurements are stacked in the center vertically, but on real people, they are offset, in other words, some have more of the measure -\nment in the back and others have more in the front. This means the shape of this manikin does not match any actual person.\nFIGURE 3.35  Size large helmet head form made from wood.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1732, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2c8a39e-8973-4c0c-b9eb-6d126f7a1b45": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2c8a39e-8973-4c0c-b9eb-6d126f7a1b45", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "150", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8bb1eec9-a96a-4094-94e8-53625711cb44", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "150", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "04385943ff87cab4905603592dcb86932eabfdadec45326b9c8b96eac6a3bea6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "150 Product Fit and Sizing\nFigure 3.37  compares the commercial manikin to the fit model it is intended to \nr\nepresent.

These kinds of difference impact apparel fit and need to be understood to avoid fitting the manikin well but not fitting real people. The manikin might be the right size but the wrong fit or it might be good enough for some gar -\nments and not others.\nIt is important to consider whether you want a copy of the person or if you want \na shape that will fit the person. Sometimes the shape that will fit the person incorpo -\nrates some of the fit intentions. For example, a shoe last is a type of manikin that is a shape for making a shoe that will fit the foot, rather than a manikin that matches the shape of the foot. The last can have a different shape depending on the intended heel height for the shoe because the heel height affects the foot pose and changes the shape of the foot.\nHat manikins are called hat blocks in the industry.

Even if it is not perfect and we still want to use it, \nthe testing can reveal its limitations that can be accounted for when it is used.\nRetail store visual display manikins should be avoided. The primary role of a \nvisual display manikin is to look attractive while displaying clothes. It is not designed to be realistic. While suitable when used for display, visual display manikins have received criticism over the years for promoting an unrealistic body image. These are stylized with exaggerated features to make the product look pleasing. This means they will not have the proportions or shapes of any real person and will rarely be good enough for the creation of a block or mock-up. Typical female display manikins will be exaggerated to have abnormally long legs and small waists.\nSometimes they are proportioned to be easy to display products rather than to \nreflect real human proportions. For example, the head form shown in Figure 3.38  is a \nform for displaying wigs. Its Head Circumference of 55 cm is approximately average for American females and 10th percentile for males. So, it is too small for males for design purposes, but it would be easy to get a product on and off this small size head. In addition, even though it is about average for Head Circumference for women, the Head Length is at the 90th percentile for females and the width at the 10th percentile. This shape of the cranium is extra-long and thin. This gives it a more pleasing nar -\nrow face for display and makes it easy to get wigs on and off. The facial features are strictly an artist\u2019s concept so the placement of the features cannot be relied upon. If Head Circumference is the only important measurement, and the head shape is not a factor, this form might be acceptable for a first mock-up for women. But if Head Circumference is the only important measurement, why do we need a 3D manikin? For most products, these kinds of manikins are only good for display not for design.\nFIGURE 3.38  Styrofoam wig form.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2068, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1fc95a2a-cfb7-4b9e-a720-fb9c58a3075f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1fc95a2a-cfb7-4b9e-a720-fb9c58a3075f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "153", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c24c4490-e9d5-4366-a6ec-95da46e2636b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "153", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "d852325a4ab7439ff3245a9b2c0c1dfe5110d1f4963480436e1831d7a3501ae4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "153 Cases and Fit Models\nThere are companies that produce custom manikins. For example, SHARP \nDummies\u00ae custom biofidelic manikins, such as the one shown in Figure 3.39 , have \na soft compressible layer that allows the body to give in a way similar to an actual \nperson\u2019s body. Not all custom manikins have shape accuracy as good as these, so be careful to verify that the shape is accurate enough in the important places.\nA specially developed manikin might also be used to represent the product and \nits fit intentions, rather than the body, thereby acting as a stepping-stone between a real body and the idealized garment shape. A good example of this is a shoe last, which although it has foot measurements built-in, is not the shape of the foot. Instead, the last provides the base shape of the finished shoe, which includes a predetermined heel height. In some instances, a manikin or form might be too detailed to allow manufacturing for a reasonable cost. For example, Kennedy et al. \n(1962)  created more lifelike hand forms for dipping to produce protective gloves. \nDuring the process there was concern that the hand forms were too detailed, with sharp edges, strong finger curvatures, and fingers very close to each other, to per -\nmit the dipping process to work effectively and permit the gloves to be removed from the forms after curing. They tested the process to resolve any manufacturing issues.\nIn the past, manikins were made using artist tools such as plaster casting, or an \nartistic interpretation of a list of measurements made into a 3D clay sculpture of the body segment such as clay face forms used for creating oxygen masks ( Alexander \net al., 1979 ; Seeler, 1961 ). These were produced before the advent of 3D scanners, so \nthey required an artistic interpretation of 1D measurements. Percentile values were often used instead of cases, so they often looked a bit like Frankenstein instead of a real person and their effectiveness was questionable.\nToday, we have 3D human scanning technology which can be used to produce \nboth physical and digital human models. Physical manikins can be made from prop -\nerly processed 3D scans using 3D printing or computer numerical controlled (CNC) \nFIGURE 3.39  Example of subject with matching lifelike manikin.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2280, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68df4f41-8bf7-4e12-a02a-a6acea8ab25c": {"__data__": {"id_": "68df4f41-8bf7-4e12-a02a-a6acea8ab25c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77302338-2a0a-4e6d-a89a-dd2407377b9f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "154", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "e7ae97dd0b2e4daa8e0eaad7184db42a698c8843f26c7f39aab79f520c3946f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "154 Product Fit and Sizing\nmilling. The process requires data processing to create a digital model first and \ninstructions on the pathways for the printer or milling machine, but then can be used either to produce a manikin or to produce a mold to make the manikin.\nCopies made with 3D printing can be cheaply and rapidly produced, which can \nmake them ideal for quick prototyping.

Some of the first DHMs, such as Articulated Total Body (ATB) and COMBIMAN (COMputerized Biomechanical MAN-Model), were nothing more than 3D figures made up of 3D cubes, rectangles, and ellipsoids (Evans, 1976 ; Leetch & Bowman, 1983 ). These were put together to estimate the bio -\nmechanics of the body for things such as crash research and cockpit layout and were estimated from 1D anthropometric measurements and mass distribution properties from cadavers.\nCommercial DHMs with a bit more human-looking features soon followed \n(e.g., Jack, Ramsis, Santos). They have been used in commercial CAD systems to design and assess human-machine interaction and prevent musculoskeletal risks due to bad postures, overloads or problems to reach an important part of the machine environment ( Duffy, 2007 , 2008 ; Scataglini & Paul, 2019 ; Tian & \nDuffy, 2011 ).\nWhile these models have proven very useful for workspace layout and visualiza -\ntion, they have many limitations that render them ineffective for wearable design. Most importantly, these models have a simplified body shape and posture without anatomical biofidelity. Figure 3.41  illustrates the difference between a commercial \nDHM (at left) developed for ergonomic assessment and a scan of an actual person of the same stature and weight (at right). For wearables that must follow the body con -\ntours, shape is critical and as a result, the shapes used in commercial DHMs today will not suffice. Fortunately, there are now better ways for representing the human body for wearables by developing DHMs using 3D scanning.\n3D human body scanning began to be developed in the 1980s ( Robinette, 1986 ) \nwith some of the first small head scanners.

Body scanners \ndelivered a digital copy of the 3D body surface, generating a 3D model of the body with the actual body shape and the possibility to calculate almost any measurement. This technology opened the possibility to create a new generation of DHM with an anatomical body shape that reproduces body features (e.g., curvatures, asymmetries, shape variations), relevant to achieve a good fitting design of a wearable. These are \nthe scan-based DHMs.\nSince the CAESAR\n\u2122 project ( Robinette et al., 1999 ), the 3D body scanning \nsurvey of reference, more than 20 similar large-scale studies have been performed \naround the world to characterize the body size and shape of different populations (Alemany et al., 2019 ). In particular, the easy accessibility of the CAESAR\n\u2122 data -\nbase, and the quality of the data, including 3D body scans, digital measurements, landmark coordinates as well as detailed documentation describing the data, has boosted the development of advanced 3D statistic tools to create synthetic 3D bod -\nies. The concepts used behind these models are based on shape analysis methods that have been developed in Physical Anthropology to study the biological shape and shape change. The book \u201cMorphometric tools for landmarks data\u201d ( Bookstein, \n1992 ) is a useful reference for understanding the fundamentals of shape analysis \nmethods.\nToday, there are several whole-body scanning technologies and a few scanners \nthat can capture the whole body in motion, which are referred to as 4D scanners. This has provided us with some tools for creating both physical and digital manikins. However, for wearable products, it is not always as easy as scanning and transferring a scan to a CAD software package or a 3D printer. For many CAD packages, the scans must be processed and adapted to the software.\nThere are several ways to generate digital manikins from 3D scans, and the best \nmethod depends on how we intend to use it and how much time and money we are willing to spend on it. Five examples, from simplest to most complex, are:\n1. Use the original scan point cloud\n2. Create a simple surfaced manikin\n3. Create a simple watertight surfaced manikin\n4. Create a standardized homologous watertight manikin\n5. Use a parameterized manikin database to select a manikin\nThe first three methods were described and illustrated in Chapter 2 , as were \nsome of the issues to be careful about. All the methods require software tools to visualize and use the scans. Some visualization tools may come with the scanner, but some scanners do not provide this. Some scanners only provide 1D measure -\nments that are automatically extracted and do not output the 3D point cloud itself, so they do not provide a 3D manikin. It is important to ensure that the point cloud is part of what the scanner provides. If a 3D point cloud is provided by the scan -\nner it is also important that it be in a format that can be viewed in software tools such as the open source tool Blender\n\u2122 or the commercial tools Polyworks\u2122 or \nAutoCAD\u2122.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3206, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1cb68a7-18ae-49f0-9b30-4c8276d0d388": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1cb68a7-18ae-49f0-9b30-4c8276d0d388", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a38d01d6-9a29-4e09-b039-534554820f39", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "157", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "e1b302fc274f1911de44c448b9fe4305ea7b7f287ff77f660865483203d0e1b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "157 Cases and Fit Models\nOriginal Point Cloud\nThe output of a 3D scanner is usually a collection of 3D points called a point cloud. \nThese can include landmark points that were pre-marked before scanning and iden-tified and named after scanning.

An example of the use of \noverlays was provided in Chapter 2 , where we showed the range of pupil locations \nin a helmet.\nWith the point cloud, we do not have a surface so we cannot accurately measure \nbetween surfaces, such as the skin surface and a wearable surface, nor can we mea -\nsure to any spot that does not have a point on it. For these measurements we need a surface.\nSurfaced Manikin\nA surfaced manikin is a very basic connection of the points to create surfaces. It can \nbe used for visualization and can measure between surfaces to some degree. Some scanners provide surfacing options otherwise, software tools (such as Meshlab\n\u2122 or \nPolyworks\u2122), may be needed to do the surfacing. The two most common surfacing \nmethods are polygonal mesh and non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS).\nA polygonal mesh connects sets of three points with flat triangles. The points con -\nnected are the original scan points and will be as precise and accurate as the scanner that obtained them. However, the surface of the triangles can be different from the true body surface, so they can be less accurate.\nNURBS surfacing is commonly used in computer graphics and CAD software \ntools. This surfacing method connects the points with surfaces, but it can also remove some of the original points. It fits the points to curves and the original points do not always lie on the NURBS surface. In addition, it simplifies the surface so some of the detail is smoothed away. However, the curved surface is smoother than the polygonal mesh surface and can be easier to work with.\nWhen there are large areas of missing data, such as the armpits, crotch area, top \nof the head, etc., these methods typically leave holes or make connections incor -\nrectly. When these areas are important, they may need to be edited. Surfaces may not be accurate, so it is important to test the accuracy and save the original point cloud.\nWatertight Surfaced Manikin\nA watertight manikin is one that does not have any holes or spaces between points. It is \nrequired for insertion into many CAD software packages and sometimes for 3D print -\ning. The first type of watertight surface manikin builds on the basic surfaced mani -\nkin but fills the remaining holes with software algorithms or tools such as Meshlab\n\u2122. \nWatertight surfaced manikins add points that were not in the scan and can also remove some of the original points to get smooth surfaces, just as simple surfacing did.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3281, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "344f53df-bb54-4014-9f3a-e3dee023eff1": {"__data__": {"id_": "344f53df-bb54-4014-9f3a-e3dee023eff1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1d82650c-ae1c-4668-b89a-7672bb2753db", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "bd14e17fef65e1c9ea898f8be41378c833ebbc9380ed5c7b5860626df05d405f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "158 Product Fit and Sizing\nStandardized Homologous Watertight Manikin\nThis is a type of manikin that is produced using standard template models. The use \nof template models for anthropometric modeling was introduced by Allen, Curless, \nand Popovi \u0107 (2003)  when the data from the CAESAR project ( Blackwell et al., 2002 ; \nRobinette et al., 1999 , 2002 ) became available. Standard template models  are pre-\nprocessed manikins that have: (1) a standard set of landmarks that can be used for \nProcrustes alignment, (2) a fixed number of evenly distributed points, and (3) the \npoints are organized so they can be treated as homologous points.\nTo create the manikin, a new scan is aligned to a template model using Procrustes \nalignment of the landmarks. Then, the template model is deformed (or re-shaped) \nto match the new scan. The re-shaped matching model is said to be standardized \nbecause all points are treated as homologous to the template model, with a fixed \nnumber of evenly distributed points. When the template model is also watertight, \nthe matching models are also watertight. The new set of points are standard points \nallowing the direct comparison of manikins. However, they are not the original scan \npoints.\nSeveral people have demonstrated that this process can enable better sub -\nject comparison ( Alemany et al., 2019 ; Ballester et al., 2016 ; Trieb et al., 2013 ). \nHowever, the quality of the template model is important, and different template \nmodels may be needed for different genders, ethnicities, and age groups. This is \nstill being studied.\nWhile this method seems to work for the whole body in a standing pose, it is not \nclear that it will work well for body segments or other poses. For example, template \nmodels of the head do not seem to be as good as template models for the whole \nbody. There are several reasons for this. First, there are not enough good, reliable \nlandmarks on the back and top of the head, so the template alignments are biased \ntoward the face. Second, the head is very spherical so there is not a strong long axis \nor second axis, so the alignments have a large error compared to manual 1D head \nmeasurements. Third, head scans include hair. Hair affects the shape, hides impor -\ntant landmarks, and dark hair for eyebrows, mustaches, and beards do not reflect \nlight so those areas may not provide data points for some scanners.\nParameterized Database Manikin\nThis method uses a sample of standardized homologous watertight manikins that \nalso have manual 1D measurements for important and relevant body dimensions. In \nthe past ten years, several researchers have developed databases of parameterized \nmanikins and demonstrated how they can be used for creating manikins to repre -\nsent specific cases ( Alemany et al., 2019 ; Ballester et al., 2018 ; Trieb et al., 2013 ). \nSince every standardized manikin has the same number of points, evenly spaced, \nand at standard locations, these researchers have demonstrated how PCA using all \nthe points can be useful for creating manikins at desired case sizes.\nIf we have 20,000 homologous 3D data points, we have 60,000 homologous vari -\nables (3*20,000). When we do a PCA analysis of these variables we get 60,000 \ncomponents from a PCA, and each subject will have an additional 60,000 variables \nfor which they have a score. Each subject can be completely recreated from their \ncomponent scores if they are known.

Since all the components \nare independent of each other by definition, they are unrelated so we can change one without affecting another. Also, the components are ordered with those explaining the greatest amount of overall variation in the data points first and the least amount of overall variation last.\nFor example, we had a dataset of more than a thousand female subjects for whom \nwe had manual 1D measurements (and age) and 3D scans. We created the standard-ized homologous manikin for each subject from her scan. Then we calculated the correlations between manually taken 1D measurements and the PC scores from the standardized 3D manikin data. These are shown in Table 3.14 .\nThe first two PC variables were strongly correlated with the selected 1D manual \nmeasurements. PC1 is strongly correlated with stature (0.98) and other height vari -\nables. Stature alone explains 96% (0.98 squared) of PC1, therefore if we know Stature, we should be able to accurately predict PC1. PC2 is strongly and nega -\ntively correlated with Weight (\u20130.93) and weight-related variables. If we know Weight and/or Hip Girth we should be able to accurately estimate the PC2 score. (The negative value indicates that as weight gets larger PC2 gets smaller.) PCs 3 through 5 had significant but small correlations with the manual measurements and age.\nTo visualize these relationships, we show the range of body shapes represented by \nthe first five PCs in Figure 3.42 . The shapes go from the mean \u2013 3 SDs (small), to the \nmean + 3 SDs (large) for each individual PC.\nWe see that the stature clearly gets taller for PC1. For PC2, we see that the hori -\nzontal body size clearly gets smaller as we move from \u20133SD to + 3SD. In other words, \nfor this PC as we move from the small values to the large values of the PC the body width does the opposite, moving from large width to small width. The statures are the same for all PC2 values. This type of PC is called a contrast and it represents an inverse relationship between stature and body width.

This type of dynamic model uses an internal skeleton \nattached to the external mesh to change and control the pose of the 3D body in combination with PCA models of shape and pose (see Figure 3.45 ). The body \nshape with the internal skeleton can be exported in the standard format FBX from Autodesk and is compatible with the CAD software used by the animation indus -\ntry.

Robinette\nABSTRACT\nThis chapter addresses all the parts of the Sustainable Product Evaluation, \nEngineering, and Design (SPEED) process that involve testing and analysis during the design and sizing loops. We will be using inferential statistical methods to test, draw conclusions, and make predictions about our product, and its design features and its sizing. We begin with a review of experimental design and analysis methods applicable to wearable design. Then we present procedures with examples in the design and sizing loops starting with the simplest and moving to the most complex. Fit testing as part of the design process is iterative and, in the beginning, the tests are simple, quick, and rudimentary. As the design develops, the tests develop as well, becoming more precise and comprehensive. Changes to the design concept are easier and less costly when done in the early stages than in the later stages. Toward the end of product development changes become more expensive and there is less room for error. The general purpose of all testing is to enable us to make better decisions and choices. This involves balancing or trading off risk, cost, and benefit. Risk is the chance of making the wrong decision and the impact of the error. There is always a risk because we can never be 100% certain about any choice. It is important to try to minimize the risk, but at some point, the additional risk reduction is not worth the cost. The procedures described in this chapter can help us manage risk and make good design decisions within a cost range we can afford.\nThe Sustainable Product Evaluation, Engineering, and Design (SPEED) process is \na systems engineering approach and that means systems testing is essential, and as Budurka (1984)  stated, it is iterative and incremental. He gave us the following defi -\nnition of systems engineering:\nSystems engineering is the iterative but controlled process in which user needs are understood and evolved, through incremental development of requirements specifica -\ntion and system design, to an operational system.\nFor wearables this includes fit testing with the wearer considered to be part of the \nsystem. Testing is used for designing complex systems because when one part of the system changes it can affect all or some of the other parts. In other words, we can fix \none problem and inadvertently cause another. This is particularly an issue for wearables \nbecause of the complexity, the wide range of differences and the constantly changing human body. For example, fat, muscle, and bone all have different densities and the 4", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2745, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "00229754-bdcc-4d30-b441-1b101220f730": {"__data__": {"id_": "00229754-bdcc-4d30-b441-1b101220f730", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3918c3cb-4637-46b7-8381-8662d5abd662", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "bb2214003be99a1d87ac934ba686e44d726dc44750105c57f3177e8089c8df06", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "167 Testing and Analysis Procedures\nlocations and distribution vary from person to person, from day to day and even from \nminute to minute as we move and breathe. Also, different areas of the body surface \nhave different numbers of nerve endings. Areas with more nerve endings are more sen -\nsitive to pressure. This means one spot on the nose, for example, might be comfortable \nfor the pressure of the nosepiece to sit, but a spot just a millimeter or two away might \nbe intolerable. Furthermore, the location that is comfortable for one person is different \nthan the location that is comfortable for another, and some people can tolerate more \npressure than others. Changes in product properties and location with respect to the \nbody affect its quality of fit and performance and changes or differences in people can \naffect the performance of the product. We do not have the technology to quantify these \ntypes of things effectively other than fit testing with human subjects.\nFit testing captures information about the impact of the physical interface \nbetween the wearable and the person. This includes such things as comfort, stabil -\nity, slippage, temperature, pressure, component locations with respect to the sub -\nject, and personal preference. Many aspects of a wearable can impact fit including \nthe materials used, the adjustment concept and mechanism used, the environment \nin which it will be worn, the area of the body with which it comes in contact, \nproduct contours, and product mass and mass distribution. As a result, fit testing \nalso reveals design issues and potential design solutions, making it essential to a \nsuccessful design process.\nIn the field of Probability and Statistics these kinds of tests are referred to as \nexperiments and designing or setting up the conditions for each test is called experi -\nmental design . We cannot be 100% certain about all things, but we can evaluate the \nprobability that they are true or are within a tolerable range. If we are confident that \nwe have the correct answer it means, we believe the chance (or probability) of being \nwrong is low or that the probable amount of error is tolerable. We design experiments \nto give us confidence in the answers to our questions with a minimal amount of cost \nin terms of time and expense. Our confidence is also influenced by the amount of risk \nwe are willing to take if we are wrong. Will an error in judgment affect the quality \nof the product, the cost of the product, the marketability of the product, the produc -\ntion time (especially if we must start over), etc.? Therefore, the goal of experimental \ndesign is to provide confidence in our design decisions for an affordable cost.\nEvery good test begins with a clear statement of the question or questions we are \ntrying to answer. The results and conclusions that can be drawn from a test depend \non the way the data are collected (experimental design), and the type of analysis we \nplan to use, so we must understand both the experimental design and the analysis \nbefore we begin. Therefore, we begin this chapter with a general review of experi -\nmental design and analysis methods most likely to be needed for fit testing of wear -\nables. The goal is to enable the reader to be able to design tests and do the analyses. \nHowever, it should also be helpful as a guide for a professional statistician to under -\nstand wearable design and the questions the manufacturers, buyers, designers, and \nengineers need to be answered. In this sense, it would allow meaningful communica -\ntion between people with different backgrounds and expertise.\nFor more information, there are many good texts on experimental design such \nas Design and Analysis of Experiments ( Montgomery, 1976 ) and good books on \nstatistics for decision making such as Statistics for Modern Business Decisions", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3848, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "079c9f4f-4dc6-4ef8-b357-36395815793d": {"__data__": {"id_": "079c9f4f-4dc6-4ef8-b357-36395815793d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "168", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c2af8d1c-d10b-4810-b306-2aa22d6e3605", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "168", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "b3c3bf744c5cfaa0ddef68c3d4cc4120d2d5056881663bf3245ab9ccff29d8d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "168 Product Fit and Sizing\n(Lapin, 1978 ). There are also good books that focus on specific aspects of design \nor analysis, such as Sampling Techniques ( Cochran, 1977 ) or Response Surface \nMethodology ( Myers & Montgomery, 1995 ).\nAfter reviewing experimental design and analysis methods in general, we dis -\ncuss experimental design and analysis specific to different points in the process. If  \nwe review the SPEED process as shown in Figure 1.1  in Chapter 1 , we see that \nwe divide wearable testing into two groups: (1) design loop tests and (2) sizing \nloop tests. The design loop testing helps us optimize the design quality given the cost and schedule limitations. The purpose is to either refine the design or refine the test procedures in preparation for the sizing loop tests. In this loop, questions are answered about the weight, product contours, adjustment features, materials,  \netc., that are comfortable enough, protect and perform the desired functions for the product, and permit the wearer to do the tasks they need or want to do. The design loop is also where we determine which variables are the best predictors of good fit and the range of good fit for those variables in the base size.\nThere are three types of design loop tests listed in the diagram: (1) pilot tests,  \n(2) stand-alone trade studies, and (3) prototype fit tests. Pilot tests are pre-experiment guidance tests that evaluate our test procedures before we begin testing. They ensure that the tools, processes, and the concept-of-fit (COF) are reasonable and effective. The other two types of tests are design guidance tests. The design guidance tests may have fewer than the full set of sizes, only some of the test conditions, or only a partial or non-functioning prototype than tests done in the sizing loop. They also do not necessarily require the use of a representative sample of the target user popula -\ntion (TP). Nonetheless, the design loop tests of full prototypes can be quite complex.\nThe sizing loop focuses on the sizes after the product is designed. This testing tells \nus if we are missing anyone with our sizes, and what assortment of sizes is needed for a given population. It enables us to evaluate the benefit of including a particular size in terms of the proportion of the population who would wear it. For example, even if we must fit the extremes of a population, it can be more cost-effective to custom-fit some people rather than build a size that may never be needed.\nThe sizing loop is the final loop for a new product we are developing, but it is \nalso the loop to use when we are evaluating a product that is already on the market. Perhaps we want to determine if the product will work for our population before we purchase it, or we may want to know if the product conforms to our fit standard. When this is the purpose of the full-fit test, we refer to it as a fit audit .\nWe do fit audits to ensure that our new products fit the same people as our previ -\nous products so that if our wearers achieved a good fit in a particular size previously, they would get a good fit in the same size of the new product. This can increase cus -\ntomer loyalty and confidence in online size selection. We also do fit audits if we do not know who we are fitting or missing so we can improve the size assortment and create a sustainable fit standard for future products.\nSizing loop tests examine all aspects of the fully functioning wearable system and \nrequire human subjects representing the full TP. Both design loop tests and sizing loop tests can be iterative; however, it is hoped that the design loop tests will provide enough guidance for the development of the first fully functioning whole system, such that the sizing loop test would only have to be done once.

In that instance, \nwe only need to do the sizing loop if we need to do a full fit audit because we have \nchanged something substantial such that we may need to change the sizing.\nThe sizing loop is done to: (1) verify that the final product sizing is acceptable, \n(2) consider cost versus benefit before selecting the set of sizes to produce or pur -\nchase, (3) determine how many of each size to build or purchase ( the tariff ), and \n(4) help the wearer find the best size and adjustment. If done well, the final test \ncan also be used to adjust the sizes and numbers to purchase for new populations \nor markets as well.\nThe complexity and scope of each test are also dependent on resources and con -\nstraints. In other words, what are our time, money, materials, and space limitations \nfor the test? What is the deadline for the answer? (Sometimes, in industry, the dead -\nline for the answer is yesterday.) What tools and product prototypes will be avail -\nable? Even if time and money are very limited, there is usually a lot that can be done \nif we use good statistical methods. For example, we might choose a more limited \nsampling method that will only address a portion of our TP or we might accept a \nlower confidence level. Therefore, it is best to start with an idea about the range of \nresources and constraints and choose our risk priorities ahead of time.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN\nThe experimental design is a plan that will meet the test goals, while minimizing \nrisk and is compatible with the available resources. It is designing what you are sam -\npling and how you are going to measure.\nSampling is a process in which a finite number of observations or entities are \ntaken from a larger population. When we say \u201cpopulation\u201d we are not just talking \nabout people and a sample from a population is also not just a sample of people. For \nwearable testing at least three populations are sampled: (1) people (test subjects), \n(2) products, and (3) conditions. Product populations are all the possible designs, \nsizes, adjustment mechanisms, materials, sized components, etc. for the product. \nConditions are all the possible use conditions for the wearable such as the environ -\nments and the tasks the wearers might do. For example, in the apparel industry, a \nprototype garment that serves as an example is also called a sample, and it can be \nthought of as an entity or single example taken from the population of all possible \ngarments. To help alleviate confusion, we call the product combinations and the \nconditions treatments  in our experimental designs.\nFit testing has two parts:\n1. What you are sampling:\na. Subjects\ni.

Analyses to be used\nRandomization is the foundation of experimental design. By randomization , we \nmean that the selection of subjects, the allocation of treatments and the order in \nwhich the trials of the experiment are run are randomly determined. It helps us mini -\nmize the effects of extraneous factors and sampling bias.\nSampling bias is a tendency to favor the selection of units with particular characteris -\ntics. This type of bias is minimized through randomization and stratification. A random sample is obtained by choosing units in a way that allows every unit an equal chance of being selected. This applies to the test subjects and the treatments. That means we should randomize the order of presentation of each condition such as the sizes to be worn during the test. This is very important for wearables because subjective opinions are critically important and, as we learn about a product, our opinion can change.\nRandomization can be achieved with simple random sampling, or with a stratified \nrandom sampling. With a simple random sample , each item from a population of \nitems has an exactly equal chance of being selected.\nStratification  is the dividing of the population into groups and selecting samples \nfrom each group. It is a method for spreading the data out, so we get more variability with the same number of observations, as well as to ensure we get sufficient representa -\ntion from important population subgroups. It can be helpful to keep the overall sample size small while getting enough variability to make good design and sizing decisions.\nIn Figure 4.1 , we show the estimated stature distribution for males from the US \npopulation ( Harrison & Robinette, 2002 ). The curve represents the approximate \nnumber of subjects at each stature. The stature values are shown at the top of the figure and the standard deviations are shown at the bottom.\nAs can be seen, there are more people (observations) in the middle than at the \nlower or higher extremes of stature. The central 160 mm range (people with statures from 1686 to 1846 mm) contains approximately 68.2% of the population while the lower 160 mm range (people less than 1686 mm in stature) and upper 160 mm range (people more than 1846 mm in stature) are each estimated to contain just 15.9% of the population. Even though the three ranges of stature are all 160 mm, the propor -\ntion of people in each range differs.\nIf we gather a simple random sample of 100 stature observations, we expect 68 \nof them to be within the middle 160 mm, 16 of them to be of the smallest 160 mm, and 16 to be of the largest 160 mm. If our sample size were only 30, we would expect  \n20 observations to be from the middle with only 5 from each of the two tails. In addi -\ntion, the 5 at each end who are outside the middle range are more likely to be close to the middle than they are to be farther away from it.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3084, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8f9a40e-733a-4994-8c78-a253e2884dce": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8f9a40e-733a-4994-8c78-a253e2884dce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e515eb55-09b0-4804-a3cb-b0f55b2d0397", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "3fc36ad6b3680c023fce5263adaed22096fe249a2f21195481c4048db16255cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "171 Testing and Analysis Procedures\nIf getting representatives who are small and large is important, we may want to \ndivide our sample into small, medium, and large groups (the strata) and randomly \nsample from the groups. This is called a stratified random sample. For example, we might use the three stature groups shown in Figure 4.1  as our strata and sample the \nsame number randomly from each group. This would give us 33 people who are less than 1686 mm, 33 people who are between 1686 mm and 1846 mm, and 33 people who are larger than 1846 mm. With 99 subjects we would have a greater spread of stature in our sample than we achieved with 100 samples using the non-stratified approach.\nThe most common groupings used in stratification are demographic character -\nistics, such as that used in Chapter 2  for representing the TP. With demographic \ngroupings, we stratify our sample to ensure we have enough representation from each group. For example, our TP might consist of gamers, including both males and females in two age groups of interest: 18\u201330 years, and 31\u201345 years. Table 4.1  is an \nexample to illustrate how stratification affects the sample. In this example, we esti -\nmated from a marketing survey of the TP that 75% are male, 25% are female, 75% are 18\u201330 years old, and 25% are 31\u201345 years old. First, we estimated the sample size in each strata if we collected a simple random sample of 120 people ( n = 120) from the \nTP. The result would approximately be the numbers in the top part of Table 4.1 . We see \nhere that we would only get 7 females aged 31\u201345 years. That is a small sample for this group so they might not be well represented.\nNext, we estimated the overall sample size if we specified that there be at least 30 \nsubjects in each stratum. A sample size of n  = 30 is a \u201crule of thumb\u201d minimum sam -\nple size in statistics. This is the threshold above which the distribution of the mean may be estimated by the standard normal distribution ( z) rather than the Student\u2019s \nt distribution and has to do with precision in the estimation of the mean.

As we see in the second part of Table 4.1 , if we use a random sample \nand do not stop sampling until we have at least 30 in each group, that will require a \nsample size of n = 515.\nThe third option we illustrate is what we refer to as the stratified random sample. \nHere we used a stratified random sample with n = 30 randomly selected subjects in \neach stratum. We still get a total of 120 subjects, but they would be evenly distributed in the subgroups as shown in the stratified sample portion of Table 4.1 .\nWith the stratified random sample, we can estimate the unstratified population \ndistribution by assigning a weight to each subject to make the total distribution match the population. That way, we get sufficient representation from the subgroups and sufficient representation of the TP with about a quarter of the number of subjects that we would have otherwise needed.\nWhile stratification can be helpful in some cases, it is not always feasible to do \nso. Stratification requires the ability to obtain subjects within each stratum (group) in a reasonable, cost-effective manner. Sampling by stature, for example, can be problematic if we do not have stature data on candidates or people we are trying to recruit. It is typically not cost-effective unless we have an in-house subject pool for whom we have anthropometric data, whereas stratified sampling by gender, age, or other demographic variable can be feasible if we can obtain this information while recruiting with a questionnaire.\nFor tests with human subjects in a free country, true randomization is nearly \nimpossible to achieve because we may choose to have someone in our sample, but they may choose not to participate.

This lets us evaluate effects within subjects \nto give us a greater ability to find significant effects. This is common for small trade \nstudies when all treatments are available and can be randomly assigned because it \nhas more statistical power for finding differences with small samples of subjects. \nWhen there are just two treatments, the repeated measures design is called a paired \ndesign .\nAnother type of paired design is to match each subject with another subject who \nhas similar characteristics. This is used a lot in medical research, but it is rarely used \nfor wearable design, so we will not discuss it here.\nThere are many ways to randomly assign treatments to subjects for testing. Testing \ncan be done using a sampling method called complete blocks, where every treatment \nis tested on everyone, in random order, or it can be done as incomplete blocks, where \neach person is only tested in some of the treatments. For example, a commonly used \nincomplete block is to estimate the size that will fit best and test the subject in three \nsizes: (1) the estimated best fit size, (2) one smaller size, and (3) one larger size. \nRandomizing the order of testing the three sizes will reduce the risk of bias toward \none of the sizes. Testing neighboring sizes should help resolve which is the best fit \nand give us an indication about the amount of size overlap or size duplication. When \nthere are many sizes or size combinations, this can be a less costly way to achieve \ngood results. It does make the analysis more complex, however.\nThere are risk, benefit, and cost trade-offs associated with each sampling method \nand there is no one method that is best for all tests. In addition, it is sometimes neces -\nsary to make do with what you have and live with the risks. For example, many com -\npanies, particularly start-ups with unique products, are more worried about the risk \nof competitors finding out about their products than they are about the risk of getting \npoor fit or a poorly functioning product. In those instances, they may prefer to use \nonly test subjects who are direct employees of the company. This is a very commonly \nused convenience sample, at least during most of the development process. It has a \nhigh risk of sample bias, both in the people who volunteer and in the responses they \ngive. We have found that employees can often be biased for perfection, and thus \nmore critical, or they can be biased for love of their product, and therefore not criti -\ncal enough.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3671, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1910724f-4067-4524-86cd-909543fa6c0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "1910724f-4067-4524-86cd-909543fa6c0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "174", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1bf784a9-f242-4505-9e17-678d2338cf1e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "174", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "7cdd7c6ea187a1be212a098186bc67eb649e242d7e098eae68223a026ee7559e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "174 Product Fit and Sizing\nThe experimental design is dependent upon both the questions that need to be \nanswered and the analysis methods we plan to use. Therefore, it is important to con-\nsider the analysis methods before deciding on the experimental design.\nANALYSIS METHODS\nAnalysis of any test data begins with statistical descriptive summaries of the results. These are simple tabulations that can be done in any spreadsheet software such as Excel\u2122, or in statistical software packages. These tell us how well the system per -\nformed and what some of the issues are. The summaries include results such as:  \n(1) the proportion of subjects who passed versus failed, (2) the proportion of poor scores on each fit question, and (3) the average body measurements for people who passed versus people who failed. This kind of information helps us hone-in on the most essential analyses to do next. There will be many options and it can save time and money to narrow them down to target the big issues. The summaries also serve as a first status report for our management or customer, who often wants the answers before the testing is complete.\nIt is usually best to visualize some of the statistical summaries in graphs, such as \na pie chart or a bar chart. It makes it easier to comprehend. In Figure 4.2 , we show a \nsummary in the form of a bar chart of the proportion of test subjects who achieved a good fit in each of two sizes. In this example, there was some overlap in the two sizes and 14.1% of the subjects got an equally good fit in both sizes. Only 7.1% failed to get a good fit. Next, we would investigate why and how we might accommodate the ones who failed. It could be we simply need to make a strap more adjustable or offer an additional pad. We might need another size, but it is possible we could accom -\nmodate them by making the size Large larger, spreading the Large and Small sizes \nFIGURE 4.2  Bar chart summarizing pass/fail and size of best fit.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1972, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ba81761-b51a-4994-9a75-2ef851caf5df": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ba81761-b51a-4994-9a75-2ef851caf5df", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cbc38548-0ed0-4973-a0a9-3a5d6f9defa8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "e1d58830640564bafb88500b09f5adc781be0853a35ccffcc6e4dc38e4f4a436", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "175 Testing and Analysis Procedures\napart more to reduce the overlap where both fit. To do this we examine the range of \nbody measurements that are accommodated in each size, which we call the range-\nof-fit  assessment.\nFit mapping  is an analysis comparing (or mapping) the range-of-fit of each \nsize with the total variability in our sample. This can lead us to decide to make a change in the base size and size assortment before we transition to the sizing loop. Sometimes we re-test the new size assortment in the design loop and sometimes in the sizing loop. This will depend upon how confident we are in the effectiveness of the sizing change. If we are happy with our sizes after the prototype system test or if all our subjects received a good fit, then we won\u2019t make a change and we are ready to move to the sizing loop.\nWe use inferential statistical methods to determine what factors affect fit and \nwhat variables predict fit. There are several different options for alternative hypoth -\neses, and each has a different statistical test. We will cover the most common ones for fit testing. The number of subjects or observations needed will vary depending upon the type of test and analysis. In Chapter 2 , we provided some examples when \nwe needed a sample that was representative of the variety of people in the TP. For some trade studies, we do not need to represent the variety of people and can have a good result with fewer than 30 subjects. For example, if we are testing the comfort of one type of padding versus another, it might be reasonable to assume that the set of subjects we use does not matter if we are just looking for the difference. We can use a paired-difference sample, where two different treatments are tested on every subject and the difference is evaluated. With this type of test, it is sometimes possible to detect a difference in comfort with as few as 10 subjects.\nMany hypothesis tests are based upon the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) which \nessentially says that if many large enough random samples of a variable are taken from a population: (1) the distribution of the mean of those samples will approxi -\nmate the normal distribution, (2) the mean of the means of the samples will approach the true population mean \u03bc , and (3) the standard deviation of the means \n(called the standard error of the mean) will approach the population standard devi -\nation \u03c3 divided by\nnwhere n is the number of samples that were drawn. This is \ntrue even if the distribution of the population itself is not normal. This theorem means the true distribution of the mean is the standard normal distribution (the z \ndistribution).\nWhy do we care about the CLT? If we know the probability distribution of a \nmean, we can use it to determine the probability that a mean is different from another mean or another value. The CLT tells us what the probability distribution of the mean is.\nHypothesis tests for which the variable\u2019s distribution is known and whose param -\neters, such as the standard deviation or error, are needed are called parametric tests. Hypothesis tests for variables for which we have not specified (or do not know) the variable\u2019s distribution are called nonparametric tests.\nThere are two types of variables that might be evaluated: continuous  and dis-\ncrete.  Continuous variables can take on any value along a range and they have an \norder to them, or in other words, a scale. They are also called scalar  variables as \na result.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3474, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48a913af-eace-4ef1-9077-432e7d8abb98": {"__data__": {"id_": "48a913af-eace-4ef1-9077-432e7d8abb98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "176", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "92dacd17-9a43-4196-93d6-f4a891e72643", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "176", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "c29a69fcd39c5ee26a85f4173848ad4eee610fc175d7611313c04c07a0e53593", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "176 Product Fit and Sizing\nDiscrete variables are variables with groupings or categories that have a limited \nnumber of choices, such as yes or no, or small, medium, or large. They are some -\ntimes called categorical variables.\nThere are two types of discrete variables that may be analyzed differently: ordi-\nnal and nominal . Ordinal variables are discrete variables that have an order to them, \nsuch as sizes listed as small, medium, and large. Nominal variables are discrete vari -\nables that do not have an order to them, such as the subjects\u2019 preference for the color \nof the product. Red is not higher or lower than Blue, for example.\nNominal variables can only be analyzed as discrete variables. Ordinal variables \ncan also be analyzed as if they were continuous. Since they have an order, we can \nassign a number to the category that indicates its place in the order to simulate a continuous variable. For example, Small would be assigned the number 1, Medium the number 2, and Large the number 3. Treating ordinal variables as continuous variables can sometimes increase the power of the test.\nThe most common statistical procedures used are listed in Table 4.2  roughly in \norder from simplest to the most complex procedure. That is not necessarily the order in which they will be used. We also provide a brief description of each type of test and some examples of scenarios where they may be applied.\nThe procedures are grouped into two categories: (1) simple analyses and  \n(2) General Linear Models (GLMs). There are some simple tests, both parametric and nonparametric, to use when there are only two treatments, outcomes, or vari -\nables, which are very common with trade studies. For more complicated analysis, the most common methods for wearables fall under GLMs. We list them as GLMs because that is where they may be found in some statistical software packages.\nstuDent\u2019s t-test\nStudent\u2019s t-test (with the associated t distribution), is one of the most common tests \nused in research. The test is named for its creator, William Sealy Gosset, who used the pseudonym \u201cStudent\u201d to publish his work because his employer, Guinness, would not allow its employees to publish. The letter t was used to represent the distribution, to differentiate it from the standard normal distribution that is represented by the letter z.\nThanks to Mr. Gosset, for inferential testing, it is not always necessary to have 30 \nobservations to find reliable significant differences. The t distribution is used when \nthe number of observations ( n) or the number of degrees of freedom ( n \u2013 1) are <30. \nWith 30 or more, the t distribution approaches the z distribution (in other words they are essentially the same), so the z distribution is usually used for large samples. For simplification purposes, most people refer to the test as the t -test regardless of which \ndistribution is used.\nThe t-test is used in two ways: to assess if two means are different or to assess \nif a mean is different than a specific value ( \u03bc\n0). The means can be subgroup means, \nregression means, overall sample means, etc. With the t-test, we use sample means \nand standard errors of the mean to estimate the probability that a mean is real (not equal to zero) or different from another mean.

t-test assumes that each sample observation is selected randomly from a nor -\nmally distributed population. Usually, the population referred to for this test is the \npopulation of the sample means. Therefore, because we believe the CLT, we assume this to be true. Since the t-test is based upon the t or the z distribution and their mean \nand standard error parameters, it is a parametric test.\nThe t distribution is different depending on the df . In this case, the df = n \u2013 1. So, \nwe might say there are many t distributions, a different one for every df less than 30. \nOnce we have 30 df we have only one distribution, the z distribution, also called the \nStandard Normal Distribution. We specify the t distribution as:\n =\u2212\u00b5=\u2212 ty\nsndf n/\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a010\nwhere yis the sample mean, \u03bc0 is a specified value, s  is the sample standard devia -\ntion, and n is the sample size.\nOnce we have calculated the value for t we must find where it falls in the t distribution \nfor the related df to determine if it is large enough to indicate significance. Most statis-\ntics text books have a lookup table in an appendix for both t and z distributions ( Lapin, \n1978; Ott, 1977 ). This can also be done using a statistical analysis software. There are \nmany free calculators available on the internet as well. We use a calculator at the Social Science Statistics website ( https://www.socscistatistics.com /). This site has many calcu -\nlators and even has a resource to help decide which statistics to use ( Stangroom, 2021 ).\nThe t-test uses independent samples. Independent samples tests are those where \neach subject is only tested in one of multiple treatments. There can be many reasons why a person cannot or should not be tested in multiple treatments.

It is meant for one comparison \nbetween two values and the probability level is based on one test. If we do many \nt-tests the probability level becomes unreliable. For example, if we set the probability \nlevel ( p) at .01, which means that only 1 out of 100 times would we get a difference \nthis large that is random, and we do 100 t-tests, we would expect one significant dif -\nference to occur that is just due to random chance.

Paired signi -\nfies both treatments were tried on each person or on matched pairs of people. For wearable design, we rarely use matched pairs of people. However, we often test two treatments on each subject because it allows us to look at the differences within subjects. Data from paired samples look like that in Table 4.4 . Since we have both \nobservations for each subject, we can subtract the scores for each subject and analyze the differences. By doing this, we filter out the person-to-person variability to obtain a meaningful comparison of the treatments.\nWhen we are comparing two treatments, we are usually testing the hypothesis \n(\nH0) that there is no difference (difference = 0) against the alternative ( HA) that one \nis better or worse than the other. We would sometimes want to test if one is better by at least a score of some value. In this instance,\nH0is that the mean difference, ( \u03bc\u03b1) is \ngreater than (or less than) some value D0.

This is similar to correlation, but it is applied to quali -\ntative or categorical variables, whereas correlation applies to continuous variables.\nWhen variables are qualitative characteristics such as discomfort level or cat -\negorical such as gender, it is sometimes useful to test to see if the variables are \nindependent. Independence means they are not related or dependent on each other. These are variables that have categories that can be counted and put into a table showing the count for every treatment, called a contingency table . The \n\u03c7\n2 distribution is used to test the null hypothesis ( H0) that the two variables are \nindependent, or in other words, have no relationship. It compares the expected frequencies in each row and column to the sample frequencies to determine if they are independent.\nFor example, if we have two product or product component treatment options and \nwe want to know if there is a relationship between gender and product preference, we might use a questionnaire and a X\n2 test. The contingency table might look like \nthe one in Table 4.5 .\nIn this example, the null hypothesis ( H0) is that gender and preference are inde -\npendent.

In this instance, linear means the straight-line relationship between two sets of data.\nCorrelations were introduced in Chapter 3 , along with the significance test for \nthem. We used correlations to help us narrow down our variables to a few key vari -\nables. Correlations are also incorporated into other tests and analyses such as linear regression and discriminant analysis. These analyses also use correlations between more than two variables which is called multiple correlation, and for variables that have been squared, log-transformed, or transformed in other ways. These will be discussed below.\ngeneRaL LIneaR moDeLs\nThe category called General Linear Models (GLMs) is the framework for several \nstatistical methods that all follow the same model pattern: dependent variable(s) = independent variable(s) + error. These models share a common type of denotation \nthat serves as a kind of shorthand, so we do not have to spell every variable out every time. We use Y and X instead of the variable names to simplify expressing the model for analysis. The models are described using a formula that looks like this:\n =\u03b2+\u03b2 +\u03b5 YXji i 0\nwhere Yj is the dependent variable(s), \u03b20is the intercept (a constant) \u03b2iis the coef -\nficient for the variable Xi which is the independent variable(s) and \u03b5is the error. The \ncoefficient \u03b2iis the part of this model that represents the effect of the X variable on \nY. The error, \u03b5,\u00a0is the term used to evaluate the likelihood that the effects are real or \ndue to random chance.\nIt is helpful to write our models in this way when we are trying to formulate the \nexperimental design to answer our questions. We would typically have one model for every question and there are typically many questions each with different outcome variables and many independent variables. It is a lot easier to list the variables as Y\n1, \nY2, Y3, \u2026 and X1, X2, \u2026 than to list all their long names, especially as they become \nmore complex.\nThe most common type of models for fit testing are the four shown in Table 4.2 : \nANOVA, Linear Regression, Discriminant Analysis, and Logistic Regression. Some of the differences in these models are shown in Table 4.6 . Linear regression is used \nto predict a continuous outcome variable ( Y) from either continuous or discrete pre -\ndictor ( X) variables, while ANOVA is used to predict a continuous outcome variable \nfrom discrete or categorical variables. Discriminant analysis predicts a discrete vari -\nable (such as product size) from continuous variables (such as stature and weight).

GLM also includes \ncombinations of these four methods.\nFor fit testing, our dependent variables ( Y variables) are usually fit scores or the \nbest fitting size. The independent variables ( X variables) are usually the anthropo -\nmetric and demographic variables. For example, if we tested one size of product and we wanted to know if one or more of five head measurements had an impact on comfort score, comfort score would be Y and the five head measurements would be \nX\n1, X2, X3, X4, and X5. Our model might look like this:\n =\u03b2+\u03b2 +\u03b2 +\u03b2 +\u03b2 +\u03b2 +\u03b5 YX X XXX 01 12 23 34 45 5\nThe \u03b2 values are called coefficients, and they represent the values that indicate the \namount of contribution of the associated variable to the prediction of Y. Each item \nwith a coefficient \u03b2 is called a term. \u03b20 is a constant that essentially adjusts the scale \nand is called the intercept. When you use software packages to calculate the models, you may be asked if you want to calculate with or without the intercept. We usually want to run the models with the intercept.\nIt is common to have two or more independent ( X) variables. It is also possible \nto have more than one Y (dependent) variable in one model. Using more than one Y \nvariable is called multivariate analysis. Usually, we do not do a multivariate analysis unless we expect that Y variables do interact with each other and there is not an easier \noption. Multivariate analysis can be difficult to understand. As a result, it is more common, for fit testing, to evaluate each dependent variable in a separate model or test rather than combining them in one multivariate model or test.\nIt is also possible to have too many X variables. Each X variable takes away at least \none degree of freedom ( df) from the error term. This is important because the error \nterm allows us to evaluate the probabilities that our estimates of X coefficients and \nY are real or due to random chance. The X coefficients are indicators of each X vari-\nable\u2019s correlation with and contribution to the estimation of Y. The df  for error is in the \ndenominator for error which means the fewer the df the larger the error term. A zero df \nfor error means it is infinitely large. If the error term is large, then we will not be able to determine the probability that the Y  predictions are real or due to random chance.\nLuckily, there are statistical methods to help us keep the number of variables to \na minimum and find combinations of X variables that are good predictors or dis-\ncriminators. Two of these used in fit testing are stepwise regression and stepwise TABLE 4.6\nDifferences Between GLM Methods\nDependent Variables Independent Variables\nGLM Method Type Dichotomous Type\nANOV A Continuous No Discrete\nLinear Regression Continuous No Both types\nDiscriminant Analysis Discrete Sometimes Continuous\nLogistic Regression Discrete Yes Both types", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2963, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9cf0ceb6-9ac3-472d-ad38-79b4d14be1f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "9cf0ceb6-9ac3-472d-ad38-79b4d14be1f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "187", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a0c55eb9-9aa3-4458-99a9-d4ee14ecf72a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "187", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "149846b8a7228b27488955b2611ebbb99f0c4553ae80f5b62fe5d345cb3074f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "187 Testing and Analysis Procedures\ndiscriminant analysis. A stepwise method creates (or fits) a series of models in steps \nand compares the models.\nThe forward stepwise regression procedure begins by creating a simple regres -\nsion of Y with each possible X variable. The candidate X variable that explains \nthe greatest amount of variation in Y is selected. Then three-dimensional regres -\nsions are performed using the remaining X  variables, one at a time and these are \ncompared. The X  candidate that further explains the greatest amount of variation \nin Y is selected. The addition of X variables one at a time is continued until no \nfurther significant Y  variation is explained. Figure 4.3  shows the estimated predic -\ntor importance from a forward stepwise regression predicting stature from other anthropometric variables.\nThere is also a backward procedure that is sometimes used. The backward procedure \nstarts with all X variables in the model and drops the one that contributes the least. It is \nless common to start with the backward procedure because it can require a lot of obser -\nvations if there are many variables. It is more common to start with the forward stepwise procedure and evaluate the removal of X  variables from the smaller set of variables.\nUsually, for fit testing, we are not just concerned about finding the best predictive \nmodel from a statistical point of view. We also want variables for other practical rea -\nsons, such as the ability of the users to take a measurement on themselves. Therefore, it is typically sufficient to just use the forward stepwise procedure to make decisions about which X variables to use.\nThe stepwise discriminant analysis process is essentially the same as stepwise \nregression. The difference is in the Y variable which for discriminant analysis is a discrete variable.\nThe exact same GLM calculations can usually be run in statistical packages in sev -\neral different places or ways. If there is a GLM feature, nearly all the GLM methods can be run in that section. The good thing is we can run very complex models there. \nThe not-so-good thing is we must specify everything every time. Luckily, some of the \neasiest and most common procedures will have their own section or drop-down menu.

For example, we may want to compare material types and their impact on comfort, when there are three or more types. ANOVA uses the F-ratio statistic to \nevaluate if there are differences.\nWhen there is only one dependent variable ( Y), it is called a univariate analysis, \nalthough the term univariate is rarely used. If there is more than one dependent vari -\nable, it is called a multivariate ANOVA or MANOVA. We rarely run MANOVA for wearable evaluations.\nIf subjects are each only tested in one of the three or more treatments, then the \ntreatments will be listed as one variable and one column in the dataset. This is called an independent measures sample.\nWhen subjects are tested in two or more of the treatments, then a repeated mea-\nsures ANOVA is appropriate. The data for a repeated measures analysis are usu -\nally arranged with a different column containing the score for each treatment. For example, the comfort score for the first material would be in one column, the com -\nfort score for the second material in another, etc. When doing a repeated measures ANOVA, it is necessary to indicate which columns contain the repeated scores.\nWhen there is only one independent variable, it is called a one-way ANOVA. \nOne-way, univariate ANOVAs are the simplest and there are free calculators avail -\nable on the internet such as the one on the Social Science Statistics website ( https://\nwww.socscistatistics.com /).\nSPSS has both a GLM section and stand-alone ANOVA sections. The latter is \nmuch easier to use. Figure 4.4  shows an example of the pull-down menus to run one-\nway ANOVAs in SPSS (version 26). They are listed under the Bayesian Statistics tab and there we find both the repeated measures one-way ANOVA and the one-way ANOVA that is not repeated.\nWhen we select the independent variables for ANOVA, we will be asked to \nselect fixed variables and/or random variables. For wearable testing, we typically have fixed independent variables in the ANOVA analyses, because we are usu -\nally interested in a fixed number of discrete treatments. For example, if we have three specific types of materials we want to test, and these are not three randomly sampled out of a large population of material types that we want to know about, then the materials variable is called a fixed variable. There are three and only three types we care about. If, on the other hand, we have a continuous range of material properties, perhaps a durometer measurement, for example, and we want to know if there is a relationship between durometer values and comfort and we randomly select durometer values to be tested, then we have a random variable. However, if we are using a durometer and we have a measurement to characterize it that is continuous or scalar, it would probably be better to do a linear regression analysis rather than ANOVA.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3181, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c832d9d-553b-4a10-99da-03f3000f7b04": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c832d9d-553b-4a10-99da-03f3000f7b04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "189", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "044a8ac9-5b38-4242-a628-2ecba0f614db", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "189", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "6608af5be7bba93f5a8c818e054099e74f9289bbe1f5f2a64af4e72deb33c98c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "189 Testing and Analysis Procedures\nLIneaR RegRessIon/step WIse LIneaR RegRessIon\nUsually, when we refer to linear regression analysis, we are referring to the method \nof least squares. Least squares regression finds the line where the deviation of points \nabove or below the line is minimized. When there is more than one independent variable, it is called a multiple regression.\nRegression equations can be calculated by entering the independent variables all \nat the one time or by entering them one at a time in a stepwise manner. The latter method is called Stepwise Regression. With Stepwise Regression each independent variable is entered separately to see which has the greatest ability to predict the dependent variable (the first step), then adding each additional variable one at a time to see which, if any, improves the ability to predict (the second step), and so on.\nStepwise regression is used to determine which variables are good predictors of \nsome continuous (scalar or ordinal) dependent variable. It is useful for understanding multiple variable relationships such as the ability of self-reported stature and weight to predict waist circumference. It can also be useful for establishing the multiple variable relationships of anthropometric variables with size-of-best-fit, if the size is scalar or ordinal such that it is in the form of a continuous variable rather than a discrete variable.\nTo run regressions in SPSS, the GLM procedure can be used, but the simplest \napproach is to use the stand-alone regression procedure as shown in the pull-down menus in Figures 4.5  and 4.6 .\nFIGURE 4.4  Running ANOVA in SPSS\u00ae (version 26).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1654, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16a6ef71-5be0-4a60-b7fa-41d5632eaa14": {"__data__": {"id_": "16a6ef71-5be0-4a60-b7fa-41d5632eaa14", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "190", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1fcebcd4-f57d-4db8-a8f7-cf7d3bd7e4d8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "190", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "78fc3335c4dc15568ee552b1f00efa43c8c29ec1b625ea7e25b5484c0c704e69", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "190 Product Fit and Sizing\nUnder the Analyze menu we find both GLM and Regression listed.

If we select \nEnter, it just uses them the way we enter them in the list. We use this option if we \nknow exactly what variables we want to use to predict our outcome ( Y).\nIf we select Stepwise, it will enter them in a stepwise fashion. We use this option \nwhen we want to know which of the variables are the best predictors of Y. The other \noptions called remove, backward, and forward are alternative stepwise methods that specify the order in which they are entered or removed. We might choose one of these if there are some variables, we specifically want to have entered first.\nWhile it is called linear regression, the regression line is not limited to being a \nstraight line. A dependent variable might be related to X in a curvilinear manner \nsuch as the quadratic equation:\n =\u03b2+\u03b2 +\u03b2 +\u03b5 YX X 01 12 12\nThis equation describes a relationship between X1 and Y that has the shape of a \nparabola. For example, if we are predicting the quality of fit in a single mid-range size helmet from an anthropometric variable such as head circumference, the fit might be poor for the smaller heads, then increasingly good toward the center and then poor again toward the larger head circumference. This is a parabolic shape that might be better characterized with a quadratic term in the model.\nDIsCRImInant anaLysIs\nDiscriminant analysis is much like linear regression except that the dependent vari -\nable is a categorical variable such as size-of-best-fit or fit pass/fail. It helps us under -\nstand which anthropometric measurements are good for sorting people into sizes or are related to fit issues. It can be used to predict discrete (nominal) variables that have more than two categories but that are not in a linear order.\nDiscriminant analysis is considered a classification method, so while it can be \ndone under a GLM function, it is often found listed as a classification method. This is the case in SPSS as shown in Figure 4.7 . When \u201cDiscriminant\u201d is selected from \nthe pull-down menu, we have another menu with several options. We select a group -\ning variable, which is our Y or dependent variable. In this instance it is ethnicity. We \nwant to see if there are proportional differences between two ethnic groups that we must consider in our design. Note that we have an ethnicity variable that lists each as a number. We must indicate the range of values for the Y variable. We selected 1 as the minimum and 2 as the maximum because these are our two groups. Next, we input the independent or X variables that we want to consider. The classification method, display, and plots we used are the defaults.\nThere are many output tables including tables that show summary statistics for \nthe groups, the steps that were taken, and variables entered and removed. The two most meaningful tables are shown in Figures 4.8  and 4.9 . These are the test of the \nfinal discriminant function selected and the coefficients of the function. The first shows that the function is significant at 0.0001 and the second is the function itself.

In this example, Waist-Ht-Natural is \nthe first variable selected and it has a large negative coefficient. The next variable \nselected is Crotch-Ht and it has a positive coefficient. This indicates that there seems to be a proportional difference between the two ethnicities. One has long legs, with a short Waist-Ht, and the other has short legs with a tall Waist-Ht. To illustrate, we graphed these two variables and plotted the ethnicity in Figure 4.10 . The pro -\nportional difference is clear. It means that the Black women in this sample have a shorter lower torso (Waist to Crotch Distance) but longer legs. This will need to be accounted for in lower body garments.\nLogIstIC RegRessIon\nLogistic regression is used to predict dependent variables that have just two options \n(dichotomous or binary), such as pass or fail in a size, or tight or not tight in a par -\nticular area such as the waist. To understand it we must first understand probability versus odds.\nThe chance of being in one category versus being in any category is called the \nprobability ( p) of being in the category. It is estimated by the ratio of observations \nthat were in the category over the total number of observations. The odds of being in a category are the ratio of the probability of being in the category ( p) to the probabil -\nity of not being in the category (1\u2013 p). For example, if a tight fit occurred four out of \nten times the probability estimate for a tight fit is 0.40 or 40% and the odds estimate for a tight fit is 0.40/1 \u2013 0.40 = 0.667 or 66.7%.\nLogistic regression uses a logarithm of the odds to predict the likelihood of all \nkinds of yes/no, in/out, or pass/fail outcomes, such as fit success in a size or fit fail -\nure in a size. A logarithm is the inverse function to exponentiation (the function that raises a quantity to a power). The logarithm of a number x in base b is the exponent to which b must be raised to produce x.

The exponent for 2 in base 10 to get 8 is 3 and this means \nthe logarithm in base 10 of 8 is 3. This is written log10 (8) = 3.\nA base, in mathematics, is the number of different digits that a system of counting \nuses to represent numbers. For example, the most common base used today is the \ndecimal system, which uses numbers 0 to 9 to count. Computers use a binary base, 0 and 1. Logistic regression uses a base called e, because of its special properties. The number e is called Euler\u2019s number after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler and is approximately 2.718. When this base is used it is called the natural log, so it is sometimes denoted Ln rather than Log or Log\ne.\nLogit is the term for the natural log of the odds, Ln( p/1 \u2013 p ). It is used to transform \nthe dependent variable ( Y) for logistic regression. For simplicity of calculations the two \noptions for Y  are entered as 1 and 0, with 1 representing being in the category and 0 \nrepresenting not being in the category. Then the probability ( p) is the probability that \nY = 1. The logistic regression equation becomes Ln( p/1 \u2013 p ) = \u03b20 + \u03b21X1 + \u03b22X2 +\n.\nBasic logistic regression is also called binary logistic regression or binomial \nlogistic regression and we show where to find it in SPSS (version 26) under the Regression function in Figure 4.5 .

We predicted the pant  \ntightness/looseness (dependent variable) from waist circumference (independent \nvariable) in an MLR equation. This gives us average probability curves for each  \npossible outcome. Here we see that if the subject\u2019s waist circumference is 100 cm, they have nearly a 0.6 or 60% probability of a good fit in the waist, with less than a 30% probability of it being either tight or loose, whereas, if they have a waist  \ncircumference of 120 cm, they have more than a 90% chance of it being tight. We can also see that at 95 cm, the chance of being good or loose is about even, and at 105 cm the chance of being good or tight is about even. This gives us some additional information that we can use to decide if we want the size or not. For example, at 95 cm it might be a little loose on us, but perhaps we like it that way.\nThe probability curves shown in this example are indications of the average prob -\nability curves when the independent variable (Waist Circumference) was correlated with the fit probability. If there is not a strong correlation these values might not be better than random chance. We look at the significance of the independent variables\u2019 coefficients to determine if they significantly influence the probability or predict fit.\nAnother way to examine how well a logistic regression performs, we use a func -\ntion called the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. This curve uses two metrics, sensitivity, and specificity. Sensitivity is the probability that the model predicts an outcome for an observation that is positive when the outcome is posi -\ntive. It is also called the true positive rate (TPR). Specificity is the probability that the model predicts an outcome that is negative when the outcome is negative. The false positive rate (FPR) is calculated as 1 \u2013 specificity. The ROC plots the TPR against the FPR.\nThe ROC curve is a classification function, so it is often found in software tools \nunder classification functions. The ROC menu can be seen in Figure 4.7  underneath \nthe discriminant function.\nDESIGN LOOP TESTS AND ANALYSIS\nDesign loop test outcomes are intended to either influence the product design or influence the test procedures. Pilot tests are pre-experiment guidance tests that evaluate our test procedures. They ensure that tools, processes, and the COF are reasonable and effective. The other two types of tests help us verify that our design concept is reasonable and help us choose between design treatments. Stand-alone trade studies compare a small number of treatments to help us decide between them, and prototype fit tests evaluate the entire human/product system.\nWe present the design loop test types in the order of simplest and easiest to most \ncomplex and challenging namely: pilot tests, stand-alone trade studies, and proto -\ntype fit tests. This is not necessarily the order in which they will be done. Tests are done when a decision is needed. For example, sometimes we find a problem during a prototype fit test and we may skip subsequent steps and go right to fixing the prod -\nuct. After we fix the problem, we may not need to repeat a pilot test and might skip right to another prototype fit test.

As with all testing, the purpose is to make better informed decisions to save time, money, and resources and have satisfied customers.\npILot tests\n\u201cMeasure twice and cut once\u201d is an old carpentry proverb indicating it is a good idea \nto double-check your measurements and your plan before you cut the wood, other -\nwise you may have to cut again and waste time and money. Just like with carpentry, the purpose of pilot testing is to save time and money by avoiding having to repeat tests or re-do the product. Pilot tests verify that our tools and COF are giving us the information we need within the time and cost constraints that we have. They guide (i.e., pilot) our subsequent fit tests. They may be done in conjunction with other tests.\nPilot tests can occur at two points in our design process. This is not to say that two \npilot tests are required. For products that already exist on the market, or products that are like products that have been on the market, the process may skip most of the design loop and start just before the sizing loop. In this instance, the pilot test needed may be the one to verify the final COF and procedures.\nThe risks associated with not doing a sufficient pilot test include:\n\u2022 None of our measurements help determine fit or why something is not fitting\n\u2022 We waste time taking measurements that do not tell us anything useful\n\u2022 We measure the wrong fit or prioritize the wrong aspects of fit\n\u2022 We get confusing results due to differences in the people doing the measur -\ning or assessments\n\u2022 We have wasted time and must redo our fit tests\n\u2022 We have a test procedure that takes too long so we cannot meet our deadline\nPrior to pilot testing the team members should have been suitably trained on how \nto measure and record, as we discussed in Chapter 2 , and the tools being used have \nbeen validated prior to selection. Therefore, before the start of the pilot test, the data collection team should be familiar with all procedures.\nThe pilot test consists of a complete run-through of the full-fit test multiple times. \nThis is like a practice run and each run-through is timed to determine if there are any bottlenecks or places that can be streamlined. This is usually done with 3\u20135 subjects and each subject should be repeated to see if the results are the same each time. This can occur within one day but for subject repeats it is good to have the repeat on a subsequent day.\nThe number of subjects is a subjective judgment call based on any issues that \nappear and any changes we may make. The purpose is to reassure us that the test will run smoothly without the need for changes. If after running through the procedures a few times we are confident, then we do not need any more subjects. It is common to run through the procedures using ourselves as subjects first and we might modify the procedures and repeat on ourselves several times. Then, we might run through the procedure with convenient subjects of varying body proportions.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3195, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c327ee9d-9911-468c-beb9-5f67ec519c5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c327ee9d-9911-468c-beb9-5f67ec519c5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "198", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b123e83c-86df-41b9-b500-6a70c3ff180f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "198", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "da3454d0717963b01cd1d6a60df66250bbb591050388491ac5d5f470d1876ee1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "198 Product Fit and Sizing\nRunning through the procedures with a few varied subjects enables us to evalu -\nate the COF, the test protocol order, the way we ask questions to ensure consistency, \nthe timing, the need for additional items and more. While the repeated data can \nbe analyzed with statistics, this is typically not necessary, assuming the tools have \nalready been validated. For these types of tests, we are not evaluating the TP, so we \ndo not need a random sample of the TP and a convenience sample of 3\u20135 subjects is \ntypically sufficient.\nIt is important to have some variety in the small number of subjects used. For \nexample, if the product is a pair of pants, make sure to include both small and large \nwaisted subjects in the pilot test. If the product is something to be worn on the face \nover the nose, have a variety of nose sizes and shapes represented in the subjects \nused. This will verify that the test procedures will work for most types. If the proce -\ndures work for some body types but not others, then we introduce bias into our data \nand that will make it difficult to sort out the sizes and fit. If we check all these things \nand verify that they work for all types ahead of time, we will save time and money \nduring the analysis phase and reduce the chance that we will have to re-do tests.\nstanD-aLone tRaDe stuDIes\nTrade studies are comparisons of a small number of treatments, such as different \nshapes, paddings, adjustment mechanisms, environmental conditions, or user tasks \nfor the purpose of narrowing down design treatments or verifying design changes \nare effective and do not cause issues elsewhere. Trade studies can be done at many \ndifferent stages of development. If, for example, it is found that the supplier for a \nparticular material is not available and a substitute material must be used, it may be \nnecessary to do a quick trade study to find a suitable replacement. These treatment \noptions are categorical, such as treatment A versus treatment B. The outcome or \neffect we are measuring is usually scalar or ordinal, such as the comfort score from \n1 to 10, or the distance from the optimal location.\nTrade studies can be done as a stand-alone test or can be done as part of a larger \nprototype fit test. Doing a stand-alone trade study can enable us to drop some of \nthe treatments before doing a larger more complex test. If a stand-alone trade-study \nresult indicates that a change to the product is needed, the change may be made to \nthe product before any further testing or analysis is done. This means it will have a \nreduced design loop.\nThis section on trade studies addresses stand-alone trade studies that have just \none independent variable (called a one-way analysis) and one dependent variable \n(called a univariate analysis). More complex trade studies will need to be done as \npart of a larger prototype test. Therefore, they will be discussed in the prototype fit \ntest below.\nTrade studies often use a convenience sample, and this is a sample of company \nemployees or close friends that have been sworn to secrecy (signed a non-disclosure \nagreement). The results are intellectual property that companies typically want to \nprotect so recruiting subjects from the TP randomly is not advisable.

If we keep these risks in mind, \nthe results can still give us valuable information to help us make better decisions.\nWith stand-alone trade-study tests, there are only one or two questions per test. \nTypically, we want a quick and inexpensive answer just to narrow down options and \nrule out options that are clearly poor choices. We are willing to accept a lot of risk \nand do not want to spend a lot of time or money. Often, we know we will have more \ntests in the future.\nFor quick stand-alone trade tests that have more than one fit variable, it is usually \nbest to reduce our fit score to one variable, such as an overall pass versus fail score. \nAnything more complex will require more time and money. This is especially true if \nthere will be prototype or full-fit tests to follow that will delve into the details of fit.\nThere are two basic trade-study questions for wearable products:\n1. Which material or component is best?\n2. Is one shape, size, or design concept better than another?\nThe first question may require a subjective opinion, but it may not need a repre -\nsentative sample if, for the item being tested, size, shape, and demographics will not \naffect the outcome. The second question assumes size, shape, and demographics will \naffect the outcome, so a more representative or varied sample is needed. The purpose \nof this test is to make a choice about which design concept to move forward with.\nThe simplest trade-study test is a comparison of two options (two treatments), but \nmore than two can also be compared. If there are just two treatments, the analysis \nconsists of a test to see if they are different. The candidate tests are:\n\u2022 Student\u2019s t-Test\n\u2022 Paired t-Test\n\u2022 Proportion Test\n\u2022 Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test\n\u2022 Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test\nIf there are more than two treatments, the analysis begins with an ANOVA to test \nif any of the treatments are different from the others, and if so, then an additional \nmultiple comparisons test (such as Tukey\u2019s or Bonferroni\u2019s Test), is done to see which \nones are best.\nThe tests can be done using either an independent design or a repeated measures \ndesign. An independent design consists of using different participants for each treat -\nment. This is often the case when we are comparing new treatments to treatments \nwe tested previously. A repeated measures design consists of testing the same indi -\nviduals on two or more treatments. This is common for small trade studies when all \ntreatments are available and can be randomly assigned because it has more statistical \npower for finding differences with small samples of subjects. When there are just two \ntreatments, the repeated measures design is called a paired design.\nFor material or component trade studies it is sometimes reasonable to assume that \ndemographics and anthropometry will not affect the outcome, particularly if we are \nusing a repeated measures or paired test sample.

Here are some examples.\nComparison of Two Treatments Using Paired Test Design\nWe found we did not have a supplier for the type of padding we were using for our \nwearable, so we want to test a new type to see if it is as comfortable or better than the old option (in other words, it is not less comfortable). Since we only want to know if it is as good or better this will be a one-sided test. We selected 10 subjects and we had each subject try both treatments and rate comfort on a scale of 1\u201310, with the order of the treatments randomized. For purposes of illustration, we analyzed the results twice, once using the Wilcoxon signed-rank nonparametric test and once using the paired t -test, a parametric test.\nThe Wilcoxon signed-rank test results are shown in Table 4.8 . The comfort score \nfor the first treatment (T1) was subtracted from the score for the second treatment (T2) to arrive at the difference (Diff.). Then the sign of the difference was recorded, as was the absolute value of the difference. The absolute values were ranked, and the sign was applied to the rankings to arrive at the signed rank. The sum of the positive ranks ( W\n+) \nwas calculated, as was the sum of the negative ranks ( W\u2013). The smaller of these two \nnumbers is W. W was compared to the critical values for the signed rank to determine \nsignificance. W was smaller than the critical value; therefore, it is significant. Here, we see that the T2 scored lower for all but one person and the difference between the options was significant for the one-sided test with p < .05. This means that the prob -\nability that T2 is better than or equal to T1 is small, T2 appears to be less comfortable.\nThe critical values for W are determined by the probabilities for the number of \npaired observations and can be looked up in a critical values table or found using sta-tistical software and calculators.

The difference between the \nscores for the two treatments is calculated (Diff.) and the mean of the differences is calculated. Then, the deviation (Dev.) is calculated by subtracting the mean from each difference value. This value is squared (Dev.\n2), and the sum of these squared \nvalues, called the sum of squares or SS, is calculated. The SS is used to calculate the Standard Error (Std. Err.), the Standard Error of the Mean (Std. Err. Mean), and along with the Mean, the Paired t score. Again, we find that the difference between \nT2 and T1 is significant with T2 scoring lower.\nWhich test is better? Both are easy to compute, but the signed-rank test has fewer \nassumptions. In addition, if the samples or populations are skewed, it may be better to test the medians rather than the means which makes the signed-rank test better as well. However, if the distribution is reasonably centered and normal, the t-test can be \nmore powerful, and most people will be more familiar with the t -test, so communi -\ncating the results to the clients may be easier.\nWe only had ten subjects in this example, yet we were able to find significance.

If we do not \nfind a significant difference, there can be several reasons, including: (1) our subjects were biased, (2) our sample was too small to detect the difference, or (3) there is no substantial difference. There are two reasons we might want to increase the sample size: (1) to have confidence that adequate variability is represented in our sample and (2) to be able to detect a true small difference if it exists. More subjects provide more power to find differences. If it is important to have more \nconfidence that T2 is better before we choose to use it (perhaps T2 is more expen -\nsive than T1), and even a small improvement would be worthwhile, then adding \nsubjects is a good idea.\nComparison of Two Treatments Using Independent Samples\nIn the example above, we had the ability to test both treatments on each subject. \nIf we had a situation where it is not practical to have each person wear each treat -\nment, so each person only tests one treatment, the samples for each treatment are called independent samples. This requires a different analysis because we no lon -\nger can subtract scores for each subject. For example, if we need to have the item worn for many hours before assessment, we may not want to run a test on a second treatment in the same day and it may not be feasible to have the subjects return for a second day.\nThere are both nonparametric and parametric tests for independent samples as \nwell. For this example, we analyzed independent sample data using the nonpara -\nmetric Wilcoxon rank-sum test (also called Mann-Whitney U Test) and the paramet -\nric Student\u2019s t-test. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test tests the medians. The Student\u2019s \nt-test assumes normality as well as equal variances in the two samples and tests  \nthe means.\nWe again want to test a new type of padding to see if it is as comfortable as or \nbetter than the old treatment (in other words, it is not less comfortable). We had a previous test of comfort for T1 that used ten subjects. We collected a new sample of ten different subjects to try T2 and rate comfort on a scale of 1\u201310. Example results for both are shown in Table 4.10 .\nHere we see that both tests found the treatments to be significantly different at \n\u03b1 = 0.05 with T2 having the higher comfort scores. Both tests use p-values, which \nindicate the probability of not being different. Smaller p-values indicate a higher \nprobability that they are different.\nIn this example, the Student\u2019s t-test has a smaller p-value than the Wilcoxon rank-\nsum test and indicates a significance at \u03b1  = 0.01. If the sample is close to the normal \ndistribution, as in this example, then the Student\u2019s t-test can be more powerful and \nmore likely to find a true difference than the rank-sum test. However, if the data are skewed or we don\u2019t want to assume a normal distribution, the nonparametric rank-sum test can be more powerful.\nComparison of Three or More Treatments Using Repeated Measures Design\nWe have three types of candidate padding materials and would like to know \nwhich one is most comfortable. We selected ten subjects and we had each subject try every treatment (in random order) and rate comfort on a scale of 1\u201310.

The first part is answered with an ANOVA, and the second part, with a multiple comparisons test. If the ANOVA does not find any types that are significantly different from each other, then there is no need to do any comparison tests.\nWhen there is only one independent variable, in this instance, the Treatment \nNumber, it is called a one-way ANOVA. Since each subject has repeated the assess -\nment on each option, it is called a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures.\nIn this example, there is only one dependent variable, the comfort score. \nWhen there is only one dependent variable, it is called a univariate analysis.

In other words, the sample for each treatment is dif -\nferent or independent of the others. The one-way ANOVA when the subjects only test one treatment each is called a one-way ANOVA with independent measures, which is the same as saying ANOVA with one independent variable with indepen -\ndent measures. This confuses some people because the word independent is used in two places. We mention it so that the correct analysis can be found regardless of the software used.\nWe have three candidate padding materials and would like to know which one is \nmost comfortable. We selected ten subjects and each subject evaluated one treatment (randomly assigned) and rated comfort on a scale of 1\u201310.\nWith an ANOVA with independent measures, the data will need to be arranged as \nshown in Table 4.12 , part a. We sorted the data by treatment for ease of entry into some \nof the calculators. Each subject has only one comfort score and that is for only one treatment. We did this analysis in SPSS, and ANOVA is found under General Linear Model. The steps used to calculate this ANOVA are shown in Figure 4.13 . Our treat -\nments are fixed variables or factors. This means we only want to know about this set of treatments.\nWhen ANOVA indicates there is a significant effect or difference in treatments, we \nnext want to know which ones were different. That requires an additional test called a multiple comparisons test. This test can be selected when we run the ANOVA. We chose Tukey\u2019s HSD test. The ANOVA results are shown in Table 4.12 , part b. Since \nthe F-ratio was 4.82976 and was significant at \u03b1 = 0.05, it is appropriate to exam -\nine the multiple comparison results shown in part c. Here, the three treatments are labeled T1 through T3. Tukey\u2019s pairwise comparisons indicate that T2 and T3 are significantly different, but the other pairs are not.\npRototype  FIt tests\nPrototype fit tests evaluate the fit and performance of the entire product-human sys -\ntem using mock-ups or prototypes of the product. That means body size and shape are necessary factors, and both the experimental design and the analysis are more complex than stand-alone trade studies.\nA mock-up is a prototype, but it is one that is not fully functional and/or not made \nfrom the intended materials. We make this distinction to emphasize that a lot can be done before a fully functioning prototype is available, and it is usually less costly to make design changes. When we progress to the fully functional products made from the intended materials, we simply call them prototypes. The test procedures are the same regardless of whether the test uses a mock-up or a fully functional prototype.\nA prototype fit test is usually a combination of many tests or experiments cor -\nresponding to the different aspects of fit and the many questions we need to answer.

For example, if we are developing a new product that has \nno predecessors, we might start with a one size prototype to learn if we need more \nthan one size. This test will have just one treatment, the size, so treatments will not \nneed to be randomized. If we are developing a product that is a modification or a \nnew design for a product that is similar to previous products, such as a new type of \npant, we might want to use the prior product to check the sizing or we might have a \nfit standard and want to verify that the sizing meets the standard or is consistent with \nthe prior products. Therefore, this prototype may come in several sizes, and we will \nneed to determine how to randomize or assign treatments.\nThere are several good experimental designs for prototype testing. The important \nfactor in making a choice is having enough information or statistical power to make \ninformed decisions within an acceptable risk range. For example, we might start \nwith just the base size and test 60 randomly selected subjects. If, during analysis, we \nfind subjects from a particular demographic are having issues, we might add more \nin a later study from that group to understand the issue. This is a good strategy if \nthe product is still developing (not mature) and changes made to it might resolve the \nproblem in the meantime.\nIn the design loop, we do not always need a full TP sample. Sometimes a smaller \nfit test sample will suffice to determine if we need to make changes to the base size \nor size range. We will need enough subjects to do a range-of-fit analysis for at least \none size. Range-of-fit analysis and the subsequent fit mapping require that we either \nhave: (1) subjects who fit and subjects who didn\u2019t fit in at least one size or (2) we have \nsubjects from the full range of the TP and everyone achieved a good fit in one size.\nFit failures can occur for different reasons for different groups of people, and this \nneeds to be considered when designing the experiment. For example, females have \nwider hips than males, but narrower shoulders. If we are designing a protective vest \nfor both genders, we may want to evaluate the fit in the hip area and shoulder area \nseparately and we will want to include a large enough sample of each gender in case \nwe need to evaluate the range of fit separately as well.\nWe want at least 30 subjects who achieve a good fit, and enough subjects who do not \nfit, to understand how much size variation can be accommodated in one size. Therefore, \nwe expect a minimum sample size for a given prototype fit test to be about 60 subjects.\nAlternatively, we might start with 30 subjects and add subjects as we learn what \ntypes of subjects we need. For example, we may find that we have a clear definition \nof the upper end of the size, but not of the lower, so we would need to add small \nsubjects to our sample and stop when we have enough to define the range of fit \nwithin a size.\nWe might start with a plan for 200\u2013300 subjects, test them in all available sizes in \nrandom order, and stop early if we find that we have enough statistical power for all \npopulation segments. This requires doing the analysis as we go, rather than waiting \nuntil the end, but that is a good practice anyway. It is more common that we start \nwith a plan for 200\u2013300 random subjects and determine we need more subjects of \na particular size.

If we were testing a product with prec -\nedents and using a full range of sizes from an earlier product, we would need more \nsubjects than if we were testing a new product with just one size developed.\nTo begin a prototype system test we start with the purpose of the test, and the list \nof questions we would like to answer for that purpose. Then we design the experi -\nment to answer the questions and test the experimental design and the COF with a \npilot test. There may be an infinite number of scenarios for prototype systems test -\ning. To explain the process, we walk through the experimental design and analysis \nfor two scenarios:\n1. Scenario 1: First test iteration with just one size\n2. Scenario 2: Existing product with fit and sizing issues in multiple sizes\nScenario 1: First Prototype Test Iteration With Just One Size\nOur prototype was a helmet with one size to test, the base size. There were two cop -\nies made of the base size to allow for two subjects to be tested at the same time. The \nhelmets were randomly assigned to the subjects. Both were measured to ensure they \nmet the specification and were indeed the same.\nThe TP included North American men and women ages 18\u201335. This was the first \nfit test of the product intended to determine if it needed modification before final -\nizing the sizing, therefore the sample need only include people who fit and people \nwho do not fit. We did not need a full TP sample. Because the TP includes both men \nand women, we included at least 30 of each gender and selected 75 subjects total,  \n38 women and 37 men.\nThe fit test team consisted of three people: (1) a greeter/scheduler, (2) a helmet \nfitter and assessor, and (3) a measurer. The subject\u2019s start times were staggered by \nhaving one subject start by being measured, and the other start by being fitted in the \nhelmet. The two subjects were assessed in two different rooms, so they did not see \neach other in the helmet or have a chance to discuss the helmet until after the test \nwas completed.\nThe specific questions we wanted to answer included:\n1. What body measurements best predict fit (key variables)?\n2. What is the range of fit in one size?\n3. Who are we fitting and who are we not fitting?\n4. Is the size well-placed or does it need to be moved?\n5. If we need more sizes, what should they be?\n6. Where are there any general fit issues that need to be fixed?\nThe COF required the product to be simultaneously comfortable and stable (not \nslip on the head when moving) for at least an hour. After a pilot test, it was decided \nthat the helmet would be comfortable if was loose enough, and it would be stable if it \nwas tight enough. Therefore, the happy medium was a good fit for both.\nPilot testing also indicated that having the subject wear the helmet for 30 minutes, \nin an indoor environment at room temperature would suffice.

It was agreed that a score of 3 or higher would pass, and 2 or lower would fail. Stability (or slippage) was a yes or no question for the investigator. After having the subject move around doing different activities, the investigator evaluated whether it slipped (0) or not (1).

There is also an outlier with a Head Circumference larger than 65 cm. We looked at the demograph -\nics of these subjects and found that they were all Asian.

The goal for \nthis organization was to fit at least 95% of the women with stocked sizes and reduce those needing alterations from 70\u201375% to 5% or less.\nThe best thing for the organization to do would have been to use the existing \npant in a prototype fit test and determine how to improve the sizing. However, they believed they would solve the problem by adding odd sizes 7 through 19 and a larger size (22). At the time even-numbered sizes were referred to as Misses or Missy sizes, and odd-numbered sizes were referred to as Junior sizes and apparel companies believed these sizes were different. They used the same fit model (case) as the exist -\ning pant, and merely added the new sizes to the grade. With these changes they were confident they could skip the prototype test and go right to a verification of the sizes in a sizing loop test. They also skipped the pilot test because the COF for this pant was well established and documented in the military uniform code, and they thought they knew what measurements they needed.\nThe test results indicated their theory about the sizes was wrong. Doubling the \nnumber of sizes offered no significant improvement over the previous pant. The per -\ncentage who achieved an acceptable fit was only 30.3% and only 6% with an excellent fit. Instead of verifying a 95% fit, they had merely increased the testing complexity, costing more, and taking longer to complete. Even though the test was done poorly it did provide some useful information and is useful as a teaching example highlight -\ning the need for prototype fit testing. Therefore, we summarize the study here.\nA sample of 250 women, ages 18\u201355 was selected. This is a large sample size for \na prototype test because this sample was intended to serve the dual purpose of rep -\nresenting the full TP sample. To meet their goal of 95%, only 13 women (or fewer) of the 250 should fail to have a size that fit. An example of the data collection sheet is shown in Table 4.13 .\nThere were only two fit scores, one by the investigator and one by the subject. The \nfit scores were a scale of 1\u20134, with 1 being poor, 2 being fair, 3 being good, and 4 being excellent. Scores of 1 or 2 were fails, as they would not meet the uniform code without alternation. They assumed they would not have fit problems, so they didn\u2019t ask questions about areas that had fit issues. For example, it would have been nice to have questions about fit such as those shown in Table 4.14 . These questions would \nhave helped us identify the problem areas and determine how to fix them.\nEach subject tried on all sizes that might be best and the one deemed to be the best \nfit by the investigators was chosen for fit testing. This size was called the Best Fit Size.\nWhile one size might be acceptable for a sizing loop test after prototype fit tests \nhave established the range of fit in a size, it was not ideal for this test, because the range of fit in a size was not known. It would have been better if the women would have been tested in more than one size so we could determine how much overlap there was in the sizes. It is possible (and turned out to be the case), to get a good fit in more than one size. If there is too much overlap the number of sizes can be reduced without loss of fit quality which saves time and money.\nIt is also possible to have a poor fit in all sizes, but for different reasons, so the \nchoice of best fitting size can be arbitrary without a pilot test and an agreed upon decision guide added to the COF. For example, sometimes it can be because the hip is too tight, and others because the waist is too large.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3719, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5513b946-b788-4b6b-ab36-87bc341ae347": {"__data__": {"id_": "5513b946-b788-4b6b-ab36-87bc341ae347", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "213", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5af5dc4a-77c3-4845-8b5c-0d888d4dae0f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "213", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "a8dda08244396275aba28024518a5f702198d7518dc8b3eea521c1b7bca67cb5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "213 Testing and Analysis Procedures\nThe ethnic groups recorded were White, Black, Asian, and Other.

Some of these were not rel -\nevant to pants but these were the measurements they were familiar with, and they \nadded to the database of body measurements for other applications. Unfortunately, \nthere were other important pant-related measurements that were needed but were not \nincluded, such as Crotch Length and Hip Breadth.\nThe data were evaluated to understand if any of the measurements that were taken \nwere good predictors of the Best Fit Size. If so, they could be used as key variables \nto understand the range of fit within a size.\nFirst, a stepwise regression analysis was done to determine the best anthropo -\nmetric measurements for predicting the Best Fit Size. The size numbers were in a \nlinear order and were treated as a scalar variable to be the dependent or Y variable. \nAll anthropometric variables were input into the stepwise regression procedure as \nindependent ( X) variables. This was done using SPSS (version 26).\nThere were three models that were statistically significant at \u03b1 = 0.001. In other words, \nthey predicted the size with a probability greater than chance. The first model was:\n =\u2212 + YX 32.66 0.047 1\nwhere Y was Best Fit Size, X1 was Hip Circumference. This means that Hip \nCircumference was the single variable that controlled the most variability in the size \nselection. The correlation ( R), of the independent variable part of the model with the \nBest Fit Size was 0.885 and the R2 was 0.782. This indicates that approximately 78% \nof the variability in the size selected is related to Hip Circumference.\nThe second model added Waist Circumference at the natural waist (Waist-Circ-\nNatural) to the first model and was:\n =\u2212 ++ YX X 33.437 0.036 0.017 12\nwhere X1 was Hip Circumference X2 was Waist Circumference. This means that \nthese two variables together controlled the most variability in the size selection, and \nthe improvement in size selection by adding the second variable was significant. The \nR for this model was 0.909 and the R2 was 0.826. This is an improvement of about \n4.4% over the first model.\nThe third model added Shoulder Circumference (Shoulder-Circ) and was:\n =\u2212 ++ + YX XX 36.148 0.034 0.013 0.007 12 3\nwhere the first two variables were the same as the other models and X3 was Shoulder \nCircumference. This seems odd, given we are evaluating a pant. However, it could \nindicate there is some other aspect of body shape that affects the size selection, but \nwe didn\u2019t have a better variable in our dataset. Perhaps Hip Breadth might have given \nus a better result, but it was not measured. In any case, Shoulder Circumference\u2019s \ncontribution was small. It improved the model correlation with Y by just 0.002, and \nwith a significance value of just 0.032.

Therefore, to clarify, we focused the graph on three sizes in the \nmiddle. We created a plot ( Figure 4.16 ) with sizes 12 and 13 indicated with black \ncircles and the others shaded a light gray. Size 11 was indicated with a larger circle than the other gray circles.\nWe see in this plot that sizes 12 and 13 are fitting the same size women. There \nseems to be a 100% overlap in sizes 12 and 13. In other words, these two seem to be duplicates of each other. Size 11 has substantial overlap but is fitting women who are a little smaller than the 12/13.\nSince 12 and 13 seemed to be the same size, we looked at pairs of the other sizes \nand saw the same result. Sizes 10 and 11 seemed to be duplicates, as did sizes 8 and 9. The manufacturer was then asked about this result and they noted that pairs of even and odd sizes, such as 12 and 13, were within sewing tolerance of each other, so they used the same pattern for both. In other words, they were the same size with differ -\nent labels  so adding the odd sizes had no added value.

If this is the range of fit within one size, then a better sizing scheme for this pant might look like the one in Figure 4.19 . This \nsizing scheme would accommodate approximately 95% of the TP with just eight sizes.

This means we should \nhave a complete and functional product with all components and functional features \nin at least one size. After this, we are ready to move toward the sizing loop.\nSizing loop testing: (1) verifies that the final product sizing is acceptable,  \n(2) examines the cost versus benefit of each size before selecting the set of sizes to \nproduce or purchase, (3) determines how many of each size to build or purchase ( the \ntariff ), and (4) provides charts or algorithms to help the wearer find the best size and \nadjustment.\nThe products of a sizing loop test are:\n\u2022 Sustainable fit standards\n\u2022 Cost-effective set of sizes for a TP\n\u2022 Accurate size selection charts/algorithms\n\u2022 Sustainable Tariff\nEvaluating if the product meets our fit standard or works for a new TP is called \na fit audit . Most sizing loop tests are fit audits. With a fit audit, we have a full set of \nsizes with a defined fit range for each and we want to check them. This can be an \nexisting product that we want to test on a new TP, a new product using a prior prod -\nuct\u2019s sizing, or a new product that has gone through prototype fit testing with all sizes \nthat we need to check on the full TP. For fit audits, we must either have or collect a \nfull TP sample with raw anthropometric data that can adequately represent the TP \nfor all important subgroups. This is important to understand who we are capturing \nin our sizes and who we are missing.\nEvaluating an existing product for a new TP is important if the new TP is thought \nto be substantially different. For example, a product produced for sale in Japan \nmay have sizing and proportioning issues when sold in Europe or the Americas.  \nA more common example might be a product that was made for one age group being \nadjusted for a different one. In this instance, the number and variety of sizes might \nnot change, but the amount of each size produced might change. An older population \nmay require more of the larger sizes and fewer of the smaller sizes.\nFor existing products, products with a precedent, or products that must meet \na fit standard, we might begin a fit audit with the COF and pilot test that falls \nbetween the design loop and the sizing loop. For example, organizations that \nare not manufacturers of the product but need to fit everyone in their organiza -\ntion (such as medical personnel, firefighters, or the military), might start with a \nCOF that is validated and approved in a pilot test, then run a sizing loop test with", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2894, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c81ac98-cd4d-48d2-a567-9dd47ce0983a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c81ac98-cd4d-48d2-a567-9dd47ce0983a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "220", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b3a0cda4-5a0d-49a6-ab80-f3148d8975fe", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "220", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "db8de222a16cf21980e14cf2c5e73224e29ce9b17c8a85ac2bb1e758d04d5104", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "220 Product Fit and Sizing\nsubjects from their organization (the TP), before they purchase in quantity. The \ntesting, if done correctly, will reveal how many of each size they will need so they will not purchase too many of some sizes and not enough of others. It is usually the case that there are sizes that will not be needed by anyone in the organization and needed sizes that are not available. This is particularly true if the product was created for a different or an unknown TP since people from different occupations have different body sizes. It is also very common for there to be duplicate sizes in a size range, just as we saw in Scenario 2 in the prototype fit testing section. This happens when manufacturers do not include sizing loop testing or fit audits in their development process. The manufacturers never learn that they have duplicates. With sizing loop testing duplicate sizes are revealed and duplicates can be dropped from the purchase.\nSome existing products are evaluated by manufacturers in a sizing loop before \nproducing the new season\u2019s line. This adjusts the sizing for changes in the design or materials used, keeps up with market changes, and ensures the sizing is effective. If the manufacturer has a sustainable sizing standard, sizing loop testing can ensure that the new product sizes will fit the same people as other product sizes in a line of wearable items. This provides customer confidence in size purchasing and maintains an effective fit for minimizing waste. If sizing loop testing reveals that the changes in the design or materials for the new season cause more serious design issues, or do not meet the fit standard the results from the sizing loop test may suggest the need for product changes and another design loop or sizing loop test.\nThe sizing loop has six steps:\n1. Conduct full-fit test\n2. Establish range of fit in each size\n3. Map against TP\n4. Create size prediction equations and charts\n5. Conduct size cost/benefit comparison of sizing alternatives\n6. Produce sizing loop output\nThe first three steps are the same as the three steps in the design loop start -\ning with prototype fit testing. There are two main differences in the sizing loop:  \n(1) the prototypes are complete final products, and (2) a full TP sample is needed, as described in Chapter 2 . The experimental design can be identical to the experimental \ndesign of a prototype fit test and it can be helpful to standardize the test procedures. Standardized procedures make analysis easier to follow and faster to complete for new versions of a product or new products of a similar type.\nThe full TP sample should have at least 200 or more subjects of each gender and \nif we are using a stratified random sample, we should have 30 subjects in each stra -\ntum, so there are enough for weighting the sample to match the strata proportions in the TP. If we have a large sample from the TP for whom we have the appropriate anthropometry and demographics when we begin the sizing loop, a smaller sample with the same measurements and demographics can be used for the fit testing. If we do not have a sufficiently large sample from the TP, then we will need to collect a large enough sample during fit testing to represent the TP.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3252, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dffbb093-4d76-4e21-93fd-9f0572afc48c": {"__data__": {"id_": "dffbb093-4d76-4e21-93fd-9f0572afc48c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "221", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1b103b32-2daa-4bee-907e-d5a6fc46fb06", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "221", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "cb3c3262c877ae950e8bf283d4bdeb89a87b68461824b719a7cfb9248c9b94c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "221 Testing and Analysis Procedures\nThe other three steps are additional analyses of the test results to produce and \nfinalize the sizing loop products, specifically the:\n1.

This is done by visually mapping the sizes on bivariates of the key variables from the full TP sample. The cost of producing each size, and the benefit of having the size for expected sales or customer satisfaction are then considered.\nWe illustrate this in the first case study in Chapter 5 . In that study, we estimated the \nrange of fit for five sizes of a woman\u2019s pant using a fit test. (Note this can be a sizing loop test or a design loop prototype fit test.) We mapped the estimated range of fit of the five sizes against a weighted full TP sample, and we compared them to another set of sizes with the same range of fit in each size, but a different base size that was more centered over the TP. The two sets of sizes are illustrated in Figure 4.20 . The original \nfive sizes are shown in part a. at the left and the new sizes in part b. at the right. By adjusting the sizes to make the Waist Circumference larger by 20 mm (a half size up for this measurement only), then dropping the smallest size and adding one larger, we increased our coverage of the TP by more than 30%. While the coverage would be increased further by dropping the smallest size remaining and adding another larger size, the company felt that would be too dramatic of a change for their current custom -\ners. Their customers are used to them having very small sizes so they felt they might not be able to attract the larger women to try their products.

This line is the best estimate of the most likely Hip Circumference for \nthe Waist Circumference location and around which the greatest concentration of subjects will occur.\nSince the grade starts from the middle size, the impact of having the wrong grade \nis not noticeable until we get to sizes that are farther away from the middle. This is one reason companies have particular issues with the largest and smallest sizes. For example, in the article by Spedding (2019)  one company had too many size 16 \nreturns and the other had size 16 always sell out. Both came to the same conclusion that they needed another size. A third company did not say what the problem was but also thought the answer was more sizes. They all knew there was a problem, but because they did not know who they were fitting and who they were missing, they could only make arbitrary guesses at how to solve it. Their guess was to add more sizes with its added expense and no idea if it would solve the problem. Maybe they did need another size, but they added the wrong one. If they would do a fit audit, they could find out and may find they do not need more sizes at all. They need better placed sizes just as in our pant example.\nSince we made a change to the grade, it is important to do an additional sizing loop \ntest to verify that our changes were effective and did not cause any other issues. It is possible to fix one thing and break something else in the process. This verification siz -\ning loop test need not be extensive. It can be more like a trade-study test where we use a convenience sample of people with selected key variable sizes to test each new size. Once we verify that the new size works, we can assume the range of fit is the same.\nFIGURE 4.21  Regression line to revise grade.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1980, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4546f42c-57a3-40ce-9fec-a4b71140479e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4546f42c-57a3-40ce-9fec-a4b71140479e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "223", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "52bb967d-00a9-4039-9a0e-80aedcbde21d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "223", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "ab7a636188a1dfcefbb6ecea5e452d2d0b2f1904d688f973132c7f76809bd44e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "223 Testing and Analysis Procedures\nDeteRmInIng the taRIFF\nAfter deciding and verifying the sizes, we must next determine how many of each \nsize to purchase and stock. A table listing the percentage or proportion of each \nsize to purchase is called a tariff.  The number of people who need each size dif -\nfers depending on the size, so it is not a good idea to purchase the same amount of every size.\nThe percentage of potential wearers who will fit in each size is important, \nbut it is not the only consideration when purchasing sizes. To create the tariff, we must also consider the people who will not get a good fit but who will buy or select it anyway, such as those who will alter it or tolerate a poor fit. When we count the number of people who will need each size, we need to count these people as well.\nTo count the number of people in each size, we must first assign a size to each of \nthe subjects in our sample. If we have fit scores for each subject, we can use the size of best fit as their assigned size. If we do not have fit scores, then we need to predict an assigned size. The simplest way to do this is to create simplified size categories based on our range-of-fit categories and our assumptions about what sizes people will buy who do not get a good fit.\nFor example, we had a pant sizing system with 14 sizes in two size ranges, a regular \nrange and a curvy range that had a larger hip. To create a tariff for this pant we drew rectangular categories using the range-of-fit ellipses as guides. The rectangular size boxes have no overlap for counting purposes. This is shown in part a. in Figure 4.22 . \nThen we added rectangular areas to the sizes based upon our assumptions about what sizes people would use who did not get a good fit but would purchase or obtain the size anyway. This is shown in part b. For example, size 20 curvy (20C) includes subjects who have a size 18 waist but larger hips than an 18 curvy shape (18C). These are people who will also select the size 20C. Size 20 regular (20R) also includes people who have smaller hips than the 20 regular shape. These are people who will also select the size 20R. Size 18 includes subjects who have a size 16 waist but larger hips.\nRectangles are used because they create an easy way to count, and while not per -\nfect, they will be close enough for a tariff. To do the counting, we use the simplified size category rectangles to assign a size to each person in our sample. For example, all people who are within the rectangle (box) with Waist Circumference greater than 990 mm and less than or equal to 1060 mm and a Hip Circumference greater than 1055 mm and less than or equal to 1225 will be assigned the size 20R. Size 20C is the sum of people in two rectangular areas (boxes), the box with the size 20 waist and curvy hip and the rectangle with the size 18 waist and the 20 curvy hip.

the tariff some sizes might be dropped. For example, it might \nnot be worth the manufacturing cost to make just 143 of the size 20R. If a size is \ndropped the proportion out of 10,000 must be re-calculated either by adding the dropped size\u2019s numbers to another size (such as adding 143 to the 206 in the 20C), or by dropping the numbers altogether and removing them from the total in a size (such as dropping 20R and reducing the total in a size to 630 \u2013 9 = 621) and recalculating the proportion, percent, and per 10,000 numbers.\nA more complex method for assigning size can be done using logistic regression, \nprovided the fit test sample is collected appropriately. First, the fit test must be done such that every person is tried in every size they can get on. Second, the overall fit in every size must be scored either as a two category (binomial), pass/fail that can be scored 0 or 1, or it must be a three or more discrete category score (multinomial) that is two directional, such as small, good, large that can be scored \u20131, 0, 1, respec -\ntively. With this information a logistic regression equation can be calculated from the fit test sample that can be used to indicate the most likely size from a person\u2019s body measurements.\nFor example, a woman\u2019s pant that came in four sizes was fit tested on sample of  \n47 women. The four sizes were Extra-Small (XS), Small (S), Medium (M), and Large (L). Each woman wore every size they could don, and every size was scored either small (\u20131), good (0), or large (1). Forty-five anthropometric measurements were also taken. Then MLR equations were calculated for each size for predicting fit qual -\nity probability from body measurements. The probability of being too small, good, and too large can then be calculated for new or additional subject from the TP.

Each subject has \na probability estimate for being too small in each size, for being good in each size \nand for being too large in each size. The probability values go from 0 to 1, with 0 being very unlikely and 1 being very likely. For example, a score of 1 in the too small area means it is very likely to be too small.\nThe likely best fit size from the logistic regression predictions is shaded in gray \nand listed in the right column. When one or more sizes have a high probability (0.8 or higher) of being a good fit, then the one with the highest probability is the most likely best fit size and is shaded gray. When no sizes have a high probability of a good fit, such as for subjects 4, 10, 11, and 14, then the subject needed a size that was not avail -\nable. In this situation, the \u201ctoo small\u201d and \u201ctoo large\u201d probabilities were examined to indicate what size they needed. For example, we see that subject 4 did not have a probability of a good fit in any size. All her good fit probability scores were less than 0.05. She also had a near 0 probability of being too small in any size, and the smallest size, had a 0.97 probability (or 97%) of being too large. This indicated that she needed an even smaller size. Therefore, the most likely best fit size was listed as XS-1.TABLE 4.17\nMultinomial Logistic Regression Prediction of Fit Quality for Each Size\nFit Quality Probability\nSubject No.Too Small Good Too

tariff we calculate the most likely best fit size for every subject in our \nfull TP sample, count the number of people in each size, and divide by the number \nof people who will wear any size. We can also decide to put the people who didn\u2019t fit in any size into the next closest size if we think that is reasonable.\nsIze pReDICtIon\nSize prediction is simply a set of tools to help the wearer get the best fitting size. \nMost size guide tables for fashion apparel, such as the women\u2019s pant size selection guide in Table 4.18 , do not illustrate the range of fit for combined measurements. \nThey usually only list a single value for each measurement. It is difficult to use these guides to find the best fitting size.\nFor example, if a woman has a Waist Circumference of 690 mm (69 cm) and \na Hip Circumference of 950 mm (95 cm) she falls more toward the medium for Waist Circumference and slightly above the small for Hip Circumference. Which size should she choose? The chart suggests the small will be too tight with a waist that is 3 cm smaller and a hip 1 cm smaller than her measurements. However, the small would not only fit her better. But she would be happier because she fits in a smaller size!\nBivariate charts with a combined variable range of fit help people select the actual \nbest size, and the one we created for the tariff is a good one to use. It is simple and easy to read, and it can be published in a catalog or posted online. The wearer can see the range of fit in each size so even if they don\u2019t know their measurements, they can often make a reasonable judgment about where they fall. To make the chart easy to read it is important to remove the data so only the size categories appear. It would look like the chart in Figure 4.23 .\nThe logistic regression method we described for the tariff is another method that \nmight be considered. For this method, the subjects cannot be expected to create or use the equations, but the fit prediction algorithms can be put into an app that does all the calculating given a subject\u2019s body measurements.\nA comparison of the accuracy of the logistic regression method versus using the \npant company\u2019s size selection chart for size prediction was done. For this test, the subject first selected the size she thought would be best based on the company\u2019s chart. Then all the sizes were fit tested and the true best size was found. The MLR equations from the earlier fit test were used for predicting the best size for each subject. The results indicated that the MLR predictions were correct 95% of the time, and the size selected using the company\u2019s chart was only accurate 45% of the time.\nTABLE 4.18\nExample of a Typical Size Guide Table (cm)\nSIZE XS S M L XL\nWAIST 62 66 70 74 78\nHIP 90 94 98 102 106", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2799, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4fb0f4c-e6d1-4aaa-9518-0f942865ab3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4fb0f4c-e6d1-4aaa-9518-0f942865ab3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "229", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b6d5d1f5-dc3f-403e-9cd7-d31a92910320", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "229", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "82310690b98ac879ef4142449e387385c0c27b6c5e3aa4800a5dec30c6f8525d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "229 Testing and Analysis Procedures\nHowever, it is not always possible or feasible to use predictive equations, because \nmany people do not have the tools or the ability to take the body measurements in the \nsame way they were taken to create the equations.

Examples of the concept-of-fit (COF), pilot testing, trade studies, prototype tests, and applica -\ntions in the sizing loop are presented in the form of real-world case studies. The case studies include examples from manufacturers, retailers, and procurement groups for organizations such as the military, firefighters, hospitals, and so on. Retailers and procurement groups may or may not be able to influence the design and sizing of existing products. However, they want to understand the sizing for several reasons such as: (1) to ensure it will accommodate their target population (TP), (2) to decide which sizes to purchase, (3) to decide how many of each size to purchase, and (4) to specify design criteria and sizing for future products. This knowledge enables better decisions that lead to improved efficiencies, profitability, and sustainability of their business. The case studies include examples of full fit tests, creating and checking a size selection chart, creating a sustainable fit standard, grading, and calculating tariffs.\nThe commercial apparel industry has been successfully making and selling apparel \nfor a profit for more than 100 years. Obviously, there are some things they are doing well and some of the procedures in our process come from experience with this industry. However, there are also many fit issues, dissatisfied customers, lost sales, and wasted sizes that end up on sales racks and garbage dumps so there is a lot of room for improvement. In this chapter, we review industry practices, discuss what works and what doesn\u2019t, and demonstrate how to improve upon them for more sus -\ntainable products and sizing.\nBACKGROUND\nThere are three types of commercial apparel production: (1) individualized apparel, (2) mass production, and (3) mass customization. Individualized apparel or made-\nto-measure  products are products styled and fitted to one individual. The process of \nfitting to the individual is called tailoring . Until the First World War, tailoring was \nthe method by which most apparel was produced. Individualized fit does not have sizes and only the individual being fitted will wear the product. In tailoring, fit stan -\ndards that apply to more than one person are not needed.\nMass production , also known as ready-to-wear or pret-a-porter, is the manufactur -\ning of large quantities of standardized products. It includes not only fashion apparel, but also technical products worn on the body, such as body armor and personal pro -\ntective equipment (PPE). Technical garments usually have specialized requirements 5\nThis chapter has been made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2877, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8c8dec4-c19c-47f9-a101-58b74f456058": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8c8dec4-c19c-47f9-a101-58b74f456058", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "232", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c97c9c87-e37d-4105-b669-63fdfc1d88a6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "232", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "42fedcd0a260aa380b53992ef750be2dd88f1fadecb782922cbbfeb52c7daceb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "232 Product Fit and Sizing\nthat must be included in the COF and testing procedures, but the overall develop -\nment and assessment process is the same. This chapter focuses on mass production \nbecause this is where the opportunities for improving sizing, maintaining fit, and \nreducing waste are most evident.\nMass customization  is a hybrid between mass production and individualized \napparel. It most commonly refers to customizing a garment by making design \nselections including fabric, color, pocket positions, custom embellishments like \nembroidery, or minor shortening or lengthening of the sleeve or leg lengths. These \nadaptations use a mass production pattern and sizing system, so the procedures of \nmass production apply.\nIn the apparel industry today, manufacturing practice follows the process of \ndesign specification (drawing and measurements), product development (PD) includ -\ning pattern and prototype, fit assessment on a single fit model representing the base \nsize, alterations and iterative fittings on the fit model prior to final approval, then \npre-production steps (grading and production specs) and finally production. The fit \nmodel is a case that is represented both as a human subject who provides feedback \nabout the fit, and with a physical manikin. Sometimes the case can be represented as \nbody measurements in a chart and a digital model as well.\nThe problems with this process arise with the fit model and grade selections and \ntheir applications via the concept-of-fit (COF). \u201cFit model selection and grades are \nstandards often unique to each company, separate from product development (PD). \nThey are part of quality control standards\u201d (Janice Larsen, formerly Lead of Fit and \nProduct Development, Lululemon, personal communication, 2023).\nUnfortunately, they are typically guesses based upon what others are doing or \nwhat has been done in the past. Sometimes they are agreed upon guesses, but they \nare guesses nonetheless, and they are not optimized for the target customers or popu -\nlation. When the companies never learn who they are fitting in their sizes they can -\nnot determine how to best fit their market.\nThere are international sizing standards for commercial apparel but they are only \nloosely followed, if at all, for many reasons: (1) it is impossible to find a fit model who \nexactly meets the standard, (2) the standards are expressed as body measurements, \nnot garment measurements so without the three-dimensional (3D) body and a COF \nit is impossible to test whether the garment meets the standard, (3) the standards are \nfor generic populations and company products are for more specific subpopulations \nsuch as specific age groups, or regions of the world, or fitness level, (4) the standards \nare for generic purposes and company products are often for more specific purposes \nsuch as uniforms or work clothes for specific occupations, garments for specific \nsports such as cycling or rock climbing, and (5) the sizing standards have not been fit \ntest verified so no one knows who will fit in the sizes or if the sizes are appropriate \nor not. Individuals and companies can do better.\nSome companies have multiple departments for a garment type, and each depart -\nment might have its own fit model and grade standard.

As a result, they produce equivalently sized garments in the two departments, doubling the cost, without adding any improvement in customers accommodated.\nSome companies are beginning to differentiate size ranges so, for example, a \nWomen\u2019s 14 might use a fit model that has larger hips for the size 14 waist size than the Misses size 14. Or a Misses Petite 14 fit model might be shorter but the same Waist size as the Misses 14 Regular. However, currently, they are mostly chosen with educated guesses, with little or no feedback about fit and size as it relates to the target population (TP). Without a fit audit, it is not clear who is fit in their size ranges, and there is a lot of money to be saved, and customers to be added by finding out.\nIn contrast, the Sustainable Product Evaluation, Engineering, and Design (SPEED) \nprocess provides validated fit ranges for each size and for each garment. The apparel producers who follow the process can provide retailers and customers with accurate and validated size prediction charts and algorithms. This ensures retailers purchase the best size assortment for their customers and customers get the correct size. This minimizes both the risk of lost sales and wasted sizes.\nThe process is improved by: (1) using methods for selecting the fit model as \ndescribed in Chapter 3  to hit the TP sweet spot, (2) fit testing on additional people \nto optimize the design (trade studies in the design loop), (3) fit testing on enough people to establish the range of fit in the base size (prototype testing in the design loop), and (4) sizing loop full fit testing combined with fit mapping against the TP to determine the most cost-effective grade, cost-effective size assortment, and tariff. This entire process does not have to be repeated for every new product if it is used once to create an effective and sustainable fit standard. This is called a fit audit. After that, only limited trade studies and/or prototype fit tests are needed to verify that the new product meets the fit standard.\nFIT AUDIT AND THE SUSTAINABLE FIT STANDARD\nWith a fit audit, we learn the range of fit in each size and the percentage of the TP who will fit in each size. We can use this information to make better decisions about the quantities to produce, buy, and stock. This means less waste. Furthermore, it enables us to develop size prediction algorithms based upon who will get an acceptable fit in each size which helps the consumer find the best size quickly and accurately. This has the potential to improve and increase online sales and minimize returns.\nA fit standard holds fit and sizing constant for all styles. With a fit standard, we \nonly change non-fit design elements, that is, those that do not affect fit negatively, when we produce a new version or a new style. Its function is to ensure consistency in fit and sizing between styles within a brand or company. A sustainable fit stan -\ndard  is a fit standard that can be followed and maintained for all products of a type \nand provide a consistently good fit for the TP with no unnecessary sizes and no size duplication. It is determined and defined after a fit audit. It is seasonless and may vary with each brand\u2019s identity. The goal is to consistently fit the same TP with dif -\nferent designs.

However, it is \nessential that these selections are based on each company\u2019s knowledge of their TP \n(target population) and how to fit it. This includes how to create and validate the \ncompany\u2019s own standard base size blocks, fit model, and grade.

Manufacturers may not \nwant to share all the results, but they could share validated and effective size-of-best-\nfit prediction algorithms or charts that even consumers could use. Unlike size charts \nused by most retailers today that are unvalidated guesses that list a single value for \neach measurement for a size, the size prediction tools resulting from the sizing loop \ntesting would produce a data-validated range of measurement values and a combina -\ntion of measurement values that would be accommodated within a size.\nCurrently, most merchants rely only on past years\u2019 sales to inform their buy -\ning metrics, but it is not known why one style sells and another doesn\u2019t, and they \ncan\u2019t have any metrics on the sale of sizes they didn\u2019t stock. If the previous year\u2019s \nsales included markdowns and returns from internet sales due to poor fit, then this \nyear is likely to be the same. The retailer might still buy the brand if they made a \nprofit despite the problems. Without fit data, neither the manufacturer nor retailer can \nimprove their fit or know how to communicate sizing in person or online sales thus \nreducing the returns due to poor fit. This is where a fit audit of different brands is use -\nful. In addition, if the retailer develops their own brand, then they need to understand \ntheir own products and sizing as well as how to communicate this to their customers. \nA sustainable fit standard enables all these goals.\nBuyers or purchasing organizations who are not manufacturers also need to know \nwho is fit and who is not. For this reason, some large organizations, such as the mili -\ntary or organizations that buy uniforms or protective equipment in large numbers, \ndo fit audits to evaluate product sizing. Their populations can differ substantially \nfrom the population for which the manufacturer designs the products. Also, they \nsometimes have unique requirements for protection, tasks to be performed while \nwearing the product, and for integration with other products. These organizations \nbenefit by doing a sizing loop full fit test with their specific COF, and with mapping \nagainst their TP. This enables them to buy only the sizes that are needed and avoid \nthe cost of duplicate sizes, thereby reducing cost and waste. It also ensures effective \nintegration of each item with people of all sizes and shapes and the other apparel and \nequipment needed.\nRetailers and procurement agencies can do fit audits to gain knowledge of who is \nfit, who is not, and how to get the right size to the user. This helps with determining \nhow many of each size to buy, whether the product will fit a given population or not, \nand helps the user get the right size the first time without the need for alterations or \nreturns. In addition, knowledge gained from fit audits allows retailers and procure -\nment agencies to compare competitor brands and/or can be used to develop tests or \nstandards that will encourage improved products for their organizations.\nWithout a fit audit and a sustainable fit standard, we are blind.

Customer fit preferences\nGRADING AND THE SWEETSPOT\nSince actual people are used for fit models, the product will fit at least one person, the fit model, and will probably fit the people who are shaped like and near the fit model in size. This is the good part. However, it is just luck if it fits the area of the population where most customers are clustered and is in the best location for starting the grade. Unless they compare the model to the raw data distribution from the TP and determine with fit testing, the range of fit for the base size, the fit model location may be out of place making the whole size range offset from the maximum accom -\nmodation area. This is exactly what happens with most apparel companies today.  \nIn other words, they will have fewer sales and more wasted sizes.\nWhen standards that control the quality of fit are missing or not used consistently \neach product can vary in who it fits. The variations can occur within the same company or even the same PD team. Companies often produce multiple labels and sometimes each of these labels may have different fit models. Sometimes no fit models are used. Sometimes if the regular fit model is on leave or sick then a substitute fit model is used. Without a fit audit and sustainable fit standard, there is no way to know if the differ -\nent models are enough alike to represent the base size or if they will result in different sizes. Using one fit model this week and another next week may result in changes to fit one and then changing again to fit the other. This leads to wasted time and money.\nFigure 5.2  shows the cost of having the base size (where the fit model falls) \nand grade at locations that are not quite right. It is a bivariate scatterplot of Waist Circumference and Hip Circumference values for 1262 women in North America that represent a TP. Sizes 2 through 20 from a sizing standard ( ASTM International, \n2015 ) are overlaid on the scatterplot along with a band called the Sweetspot. The \nSweetspot is the area that would be most effective and accommodate the most peo -\nple. This ASTM sizing standard has been updated since this version, but the even grade it uses (where Waist Circumference and Hip Circumference are changed by the same amount), is still in common use. The percentage of people contained within the ASTM grade (called the existing grade in the figure), for the sizes \u00b1 40 mm is \ncompared to the percentage of people contained within the Sweetspot line \u00b140 mm. \nWe see that the existing grade has 14.7% fewer people.\nAs the grade moves away from the base size it can quickly go into an area where \nthere are few customers (see sizes 16 through 20) and miss the areas where there", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3229, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd5adc4b-ad94-4965-b7fe-a71b79a4d51f": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd5adc4b-ad94-4965-b7fe-a71b79a4d51f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "237", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6c9a292e-7c0a-4ef5-9ea7-e1e8e7d8078b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "237", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "ded0fc67d550a19d08303dbfd97ccc5243bbd4941ca077b6de5dd0e520e24900", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "237 Mass-Produced Apparel\nare many potential customers. When the grade goes into an area where there are \nfew customers this can cause the smallest and largest sizes to end up on the sales rack more often than the middle sizes. When this happens companies will often delete sizes rather than explore if they have a grading issue. This reduces sales even further.\nSometimes the relative growth of one part of the body is different from other body \nparts. The study of the relative growth of parts of the body in relation to the growth of the whole is known as allometry. When we grade by matching the body growth in dif -\nferent body areas, we call it allometric grading. The Sweetspot shown in Figure 5.2  is \nthe allometric grade for Waist Circumference and Hip Circumference. The allometric grade for other body dimensions is determined using regression prediction from the key dimensions.\nIn Figure 5.3 , we show just the base size 10 versus the Sweetspot. Here we see that \nit is off-center or larger in the hip than the Sweetspot center-line. The other sizes are determined by adding and subtracting from the base size, so it is important to have a good base size location. In this size range when the base size location was combined with the even grade, the size range ended up having nearly 15% fewer people in the same number of sizes than with a better base size location and allometric grade. With a fit audit, we would have known this and been able to correct it in the fit standard.\nIn Figures 5.2  and 5.3 , we used a \u00b1 40 mm range to simulate the range of fit, but \nthe true range of fit is determined by the product and varies from product to product. The true range of fit is estimated by fit testing.

The product acts like a funnel that captures some people and loses others. The size and shape of the track pant range of fit ellipse, or funnel, is larger and shaped differently to the range of fit ellipse for the woven pant. The track pant has stretchy knit fabric and an elastic waistband so it will fit a much larger range of people than the same size pant with a more inflexible woven fabric without elastic in the waist. The elastic waist also means the range of fit in the waist is larger than the range of fit in the hip. For the woven pant, the waist fit range and the hip fit range are very similar, hence the fit ellipse is more circular.\nSometimes different product types will require different size ranges. A stretch \npant might be labeled small, medium etc., and come in fewer sizes. Sometimes the company might leave the sizes as 8, 10, 12, etc., and allow much more overlap in the sizing. Fit testing is needed to determine what the range of fit is so that the best combination of sizes can be determined. We don\u2019t have to go through the whole SPEED process for every new product if we establish a fit standard for the different product types using a fit audit. After that, we may only need a small trade study or prototype test when the first product sample is produced to verify the product meets the standard.\nBENEFITS OF THE SPEED PROCESS\nThe use of the SPEED process varies depending on the history of the prod -\nuct, the existing knowledge base, the confidence we have in the sizing and fit standards we are using and other factors. Some examples of specific issues for mass-produced products and suggestions to resolve them are listed in  \nTable 5.1 .\nCASE STUDIES\nA case study is a detailed example in a real-world context. In the theoretical world things always go as planned. In the real world, not so much. We have prepared a few real-world examples to better explain our process, and how it looks when used in the real world. They illustrate how, with careful planning, even when things go wrong, we can often still glean the information we need to make good decisions. They also illustrate the need for pilot testing, measuring everything to ensure things are within spec and carefully planning before we start.

We were asked to help them understand what the issues were and \nto improve their sizing. One of the first items we assessed was their best-selling pant \nthat was already on the market and in stores.\nThe company had a fit model and a manikin representing their base size case, \nand they had an established grade for five sizes. This means they had completed the \nfirst three steps in the design loop, case selection, design, and prototyping. However, \nthey did not know how representative their base size case was, nor how well placed \nit might be for their targeted market. They also did not know the range of fit within a \nsize, nor if their grade was well placed for the market. They did not know who they \nwere fitting and who they were missing with their size assortment. This is typical in \ntoday\u2019s apparel industry. This study answered all these questions and was completed \nin six months. While it did not follow the process in order, it essentially involved all \nthe parts of the SPEED process.\nThe study outcomes improved the following: (1) the base pattern, (2) the size \nassortment, (3) the grade, (4) the cut ratio (tariff), and (5) the COF. The result was an \nimproved fit in all sizes and an increase in the targeted market (TP) coverage from \n45.5% of the TP to 63% (a 38.5% increase in potential sales) with a shift of the base \nsize (added 31.8%) and adding one size (6.7%). This study also gave the company a \nnew capability to make informed decisions about sizing for different and new markets.\nInputs\nThe study began by establishing the inputs: (1) product requirements and design \nconcept, (2) resources, and (3) TP demographics and anthropometry. The product \nrequirements were expressed in the COF document.\nAll company personnel who were involved with some aspect of fit were tasked \nwith participating in its development. It is important to have consensus and this is \nonly achieved by having all the stakeholders together so they can debate any areas of \ndisagreement. A meeting was held with all of them to draft the first COF and to wit -\nness the pilot test of the COF to finalize it. The pilot test was used because different \npeople who are technically the same size can have different fit issues. We needed to \nidentify them and classify them as pass or fail before we began testing. Reviewing \nhow the product fits on a variety of people helps us refine our definition of fit so \nit will apply to everyone. Some aspects of fit can be seen in a photo, but comfort-\nrelated issues cannot be seen, so we need subjects to tell us.\nThose present were senior management (who have the final say on fit), design, PD, \nbuyers/merchants, and the regular fit model who also tried on the garments. Each \nidea was tested. Then everyone thrashed out what they thought was a good fit in each \narea of the garment. We did not move on until we reached a consensus. Specifically, \neach fit statement had metrics that everyone signed off on. So, for example, we \ndecided how long was too long in the crotch and how to measure it. We also decided \nwhat was a pass or fail. The questions to be used in the fit questionnaires were based \ndirectly on the COF and accounted for the subject\u2019s opinion overall as well as in a \nvariety of pant areas so we could tease out problem spots.\nTo assist us, the regular fit model tried on sizes that were both too small and too \nbig. We also had a second model try on the sizes to test ideas. This took about one \nday. Each decision was documented.

Software used was Google Forms\u2122, Microsoft Office\u2122 suite, SPSS\u00ae, and \nBlender\u2122.\nThe company also had garment-specific anthropometric measurements they \nwanted to be collected and we added a few to these for cross-comparison with exist -\ning databases. A total of 56 measurements were included and these were documented \nin an anthropometry manual. We took anthropometric measurements of each sub -\nject, in addition to the fit scores in all the fit tests and trials.\nThe company had only collected basic demographics previously which included \nname, email, and geographical location of purchases. However, they had an \u201cideal\u201d \nprofile of their customer that included females, aged 18\u201360 and professionals, with a \ncertain income band. They also estimated they would be relatively fit, so we limited \nthem to women with hip measurements below 1300 mm and/or waist measurements \nless than 1200 mm. To characterize the TP it was decided to include some additional \nmore specific information including age, race (as this can affect fit), occupation, \nexercise frequency, self-reported height, weight, bra size, usual clothes size, and size \nin the brand. This questionnaire was deployed to the retail outlets. Separately we \nasked if we could have contact details as potentially this database could be used to \nrecruit participants, but this was explained as part of the privacy policy and per -\nmission status was recorded on the consent form. This demographic questionnaire \nwas a self-reported questionnaire. We also had a version for each subject recruited \nwhich we the investigator team filled out. These could be merged later to expand the \ndatabase.\nDesign Loop\nFor the first pilot test, we were evaluating both the COF and the test procedures. We \ntested the pant on five employees as subjects. We checked the overall anthropometry \nand fit questionnaires. We noted efficiency, errors, inconsistencies, and clarifications. \nIn addition, we checked how our COF worked in field conditions and timed the tests \nto see if we could improve the workflow. We checked the training and performance \nof the team.\nWe made the necessary minor adjustments that included changing the order of \nsome questions to make them flow better. We timed the workflow and made sure all \nthe measuring and fitting could be completed in one hour per subject.\nWe tested and finalized examples of how we scored fit in the COF. For example, \nwe had a subject that was wearing a pant that we would have described as slightly \ntoo big. This made the pant waist slip down the torso, to rest on a circumference \nbelow the waist. If the pant waist was measured in that location, then the waist cir -\ncumference would have been rated as perfect and the crotch length as slightly too \nlong. However, if the subject adjusted the waist location to her actual waist, then the \nwaist would have been rated slightly too loose and the crotch length rated perfect. \nThis needed clarification in the COF. We decided that for circumstances like that, we \nshould adjust the pant to the correct waist location and code its fit problem as slightly \ntoo loose in the waist and perfect for the crotch length.

This was one of several clarifications to the \nCOF. We documented final COF decisions in a fit manual.\nThe products of this first pilot test were: a prototype that was within spec for test -\ning, a tested COF, and validated test procedures and manuals. Once verified the final \nCOF was officially signed off.\nWe next began a prototype test. The sample test garments were sizes 34, 36, 38, \n40, and 42. Each subject was tested in every size they could don. The process was:\n1. Greet the participant, explain the project, provide an information sheet, and \nobtain consent in writing\n2. Complete the demographics questionnaire\n3. Measure the subject in standard bike shorts and tops over their own \nunderwear\n4. Complete the fit assessments in multiple sizes\nFor the fit testing, each participant started with their estimated size of best fit. \nThis was determined by reviewing the size they normally bought in pants from the \ndemographics questionnaire and was reviewed visually with a quick try-on. This \nstarting size was recorded, and the fit assessment questionnaire was completed. Then \neach subject was tried in a size smaller and the fit assessment was repeated. If there \nwas an even smaller size this was assessed next. When the progressively smaller \ngarments no longer were don-able then we went to size one larger than the starting \nsize and assessed it. If the participant did not receive a fit in any garment they were \nrecorded as none-fit. We also recorded what size we thought they would fit if they \nneeded a size that was not available. If they achieved a passed fit in multiple garment \nsizes, then this was recorded along with selecting a single size of best fit.\nIn terms of experimental design, it might have been better to randomize the order \nof the presentation of the sizes to the subject. However, this is much more difficult \nto execute and keep accurate track of which size is being assessed. We decided that \ncould lead to recording errors and would be much worse than any bias that might \nexist because of the lack of randomization in the order.\nThe size presentation order was controlled using Google Forms\u2122. The starting \nsize was recorded and labeled as size X in the form. X \u2212 1 was listed as the size \nsmaller, and X + 1 as the size larger. The first question with each size was \u201cis the \nsize donnable?\u201d If the subject could not don the pant it was recorded as a fail and we \nmoved to the next size or the next subject.\nThe original plan had been to do one full fit test (sizing loop), which we refer to \nas a fit audit. However, this assumed the garment\u2019s proportioning was good for the \nsizes already in the shops. In fact, after the first 30 subjects were tested it became \nclear that there were major proportioning issues. The subjects were saying they were \nafraid to sit down in case they broke the zip, and the pant was so uncomfortable that \nit was dubbed a \u201cstanding only\u201d pant. These were the critiques of the best fit size!\nWe missed that there was a general fit problem when we did the pilot test because \nwe did not have enough subjects.

We determined that the \noverall crotch length was good and that the problem could be fixed by shortening the front crotch length at both the front waist and front crotch fork, and simultaneously lengthening the back crotch length at the back waist and also the inside leg fork. This left the overall length unchanged but improved the sitting and bending comfort. The amounts were small, so the pant looked the same.\nThis general fit problem required alteration and the creation of new pant pro -\ntotypes. Testing was stopped and resumed when the altered pant prototypes were ready. Since this was considered a new pant, the results of the two fit tests couldn\u2019t be combined. Therefore, the test with the first 30 subjects was used as a prototype fit test (a design loop test), to guide the design. It resulted in two adjustment recom -\nmendations for the base size of the pant, the one we described above as well as to slightly elasticize the waistband.\nNext, prototypes were made incorporating the recommendations and tested with a \nsmall trade study test with eight subjects. This compared the original base size (size 36), to the new base size to test the design modifications. This is a paired comparisons test, and the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was used and indicated a significant improve -\nment in fit in the new base size. Seven out of eight (87.5%) of the subjects had equal or improved fit with the new changes. Five of these had improved enough that they indicated they would now be comfortable enough to buy the pant, whereas previously they would not. The one person who preferred the original pant felt the new base size was too loose. Examining her waist and hip proportion it was determined that with the changes she would now probably be a better fit in the next smaller size, the size 34. That size was not available for this test so we could not confirm, but if true this would make a happier customer as well. Most women like to know they fit in a smaller size! This indi -\ncates that the change in the crotch was a good change and should be kept. The new pant was better than the original. This gave us enough confidence to move to the sizing loop.\nSizing Loop\nOnce all new pant prototypes had been produced, we did a full fit test. We followed \nthe same procedures used in the prototype test. We measured and assessed an addi -\ntional 40 people.\nPrior experience had shown that Hip Girth and Waist Girth were good predictors \nof the size of best fit for a pant, so we began by plotting the best fitting size on a Hip Girth by Waist Girth bivariate chart of our fit test sample. We immediately realized there was something wrong with the size 38. As can be seen in Figure 5.5 , while \nthere is a clear range of fit for the base size, size 36, and for the larger size, size 40, there are many no fits in the area where the size 38 should be. We measured the size 38 prototype and found that it had a sewing error that had stretched the back crotch and made this outside of tolerance. This was something we should have verified before testing, and it shows the importance of measuring the prototypes and verify -\ning that they are within specification before beginning testing.\nWe measured the other sizes and found they were all correctly cut and sewn, and \nsince we had enough subjects to determine the range of fit for two sizes, sizes 36 and 40, we felt confident in the assumption that the range of fit for the correctly sewn size 38 would be similar.

The CBA begins with who we will fit in any size \nassortment, and who will be missing, and the percentage of people who will get a good fit in each size. With this information we can compare the percentage of potential new customers or users we might gain, current customers we might retain or lose, against the costs of producing or stocking the size. For this, we need to understand how our sizes accommodate our target market. There aren\u2019t enough test subjects in the fit test sample to see how these sizes will accommodate the TP. To increase our TP sample size, we added anthropometry data drawn from another (proprietary) data set to create the full TP sample. The raw data was then tailored to represent the TP. The gender was female. Anyone with a hip measurement above 1300 mm and/or a waist measurement of greater than 1200 was excluded. This reduced our full TP sample size to N = 521.\nNext, we plotted the size 36 and 40 ranges on the full TP sample. This is shown \nin Figure 5.6 . This indicates that the size range has a Waist Girth that is a little below \nthe ideal coverage area.\nMoving the sizes up (making the base size Waist Girth larger by 20 mm), will \nincrease the TP coverage, as shown in Figure 5.7 . Here we show all five sizes before \nand after the shift. This simple shift to a larger waist gains 6.5% more people (repre -\nsenting a 14.3% increase in potential sales). This change is in the base size to locate it over the Sweetspot. We haven\u2019t yet examined the grade.\nNext, we examined the size assortment. We also see in this figure that there are \nmany more larger people than smaller ones. So, we examined the addition of a larger size, size 44, and dropping the smallest size, size 34. This is shown in Figure 5.8 . \nThis set of sizes increases the TP coverage to 59.6%. This combination is a 14.1% increase in TP coverage and represents a 31.8% increase in potential sales with the same number of sizes. The company decided to add the size 44 and keep the size \nFIGURE 5.5  Hip Girth (mm) by Waist Girth with best fit sizes indicated.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2129, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f066de85-b9eb-46c1-8497-d54cba50b535": {"__data__": {"id_": "f066de85-b9eb-46c1-8497-d54cba50b535", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "248", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "680931b0-c0e8-4b7a-a067-7fe78d6f66b2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "248", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "6ac44ee0f93179ca0502636bd7ce8c8334ece1ac6ac4735c5a255a0fca8fc530", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "248 Product Fit and Sizing\n34, for a total of six sizes. This represented a 63% coverage of the TP and a 38.5% \nincrease in potential sales. They felt that their customers were used to having smaller sizes. They will need to advertise that they have added a size to attract the new busi -\nness. The final set of sizes is shown in Figure 5.9 .\nThe company would have liked to increase the size of the grade (change it from \na 4 cm to 5 cm grade) but the testing showed that if they had gone down that route there would have been people in-between sizes and they would have lost sales, so they decided against this course of action.\nThe company used the results to adjust their company fit standard for pants. The new \nfit standard would use the same fit model and manikin but make the Waist Circumference 20 mm larger and the corresponding COF 20 mm larger in the waist. The block pattern for the pant, would also have 20 mm added to the waist. The fit standard would have the same grade and add one size which would extend this grade out to the size 44.\nTo create the tariff indicating how many of each size to manufacture and stock \nwe first created a size selection chart. This is a chart to help the customer select the best fitting size. This would be the garment they select, so counting how many are in each of the categories in the chart would be a good estimate of how many of each size garment to produce and purchase, that is tariff.\nFor practical purposes, counting for the tariff and communicating with customers, \nthe size selection chart cannot have overlap in the size categories, and it needs to have squared corners that follow along the grid lines of the bivariate chart so that the user can follow the grid lines to find their size. The process to create the size selection chart is shown in Figure 5.10 .

The AmSe recruits independently of gen-der so they anticipated that recruitment would soon reflect the gender proportion in the university paramedic cohort (50:50). In keeping with this anticipated changing workforce demographic, the AmSe reviewed uniform fit for women. It was found that there were substantial fit problems with the pants and even some female worker injury claims involving pant fit. These women were having difficulty with essential activities reportedly due to a tight fit in the crotch region. These activities included bending forward over patients, squatting when the patient was on the ground, and kneeling with one knee down on the ground and the other up (the Knight\u2019s Pose).\nTo better understand the fit problem a prototype fit test was done. The prototype \nselected for testing was the most used cargo-style pant. This pant was intended to reach the waist or sit slightly above the waist worn with a duty belt. It came in two size ranges, male and female. Males had a 27 size range assortment and women had a 10 size assortment in this pant. The manufacturer noted the female pants were not being purchased so they offered more limited sizes than the male size range. They did not investigate the reason for the poor sales of the female pant but assumed it was because there were fewer females in the AmSe. However, an estimated 80% of the women in the AmSe reported wearing the male pants. This seemed to indicate there were proportioning and sizing issues with the female pant.\nThe TP for the study was female emergency service paramedics and the assess -\nments included 3D scanning with and without the pant, and software overlays of the scans. The 3D scanning and scan overlays allowed us to clearly visualize the issues and recommend solutions. This is an example showing how small prototype fit tests can inform the design.\nInputs\nA scan of the pant and a photo of the pocket detail is shown in Figure 5.11 . It was \na polyester-cotton twill with minimal stretch in the ambulance corporate colors \n(gray with hi-visibility stripes and branding). It had a front opening fly and button at the waist, with a one-quarter elastic waist (two waist panels by one-eighth) to aid in comfort and increase the range of fit in a size. It had six pockets, two rear patch style, two front in-seam cut-away pockets (like jeans), and lastly two off-set cargo patch pockets: one on each thigh. Pockets are needed for numerous items including security ID badges, vaccination cards (for entry to aged care facilities), pager, radio, pens, torch/flashlight, spare mask, and mobile phone, at minimum. Car keys hang from the duty belt. Extras include safety glasses, PPE such as gloves and spare masks, and other items like lip balm. So, the ability to include these things in the pockets was part of the COF, and the subjects were tested with items in all the pockets.\nSince a key issue with these pants is movement and performance, the COF \nincluded having the subjects kneel, squat, and bend before assessing tightness,", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3346, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d1d889f6-89fd-4acf-9e46-bf8665c51067": {"__data__": {"id_": "d1d889f6-89fd-4acf-9e46-bf8665c51067", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "253", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ff023a9a-1c47-4662-b769-c8abaa30fe10", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "253", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "8b524bc24a106c3946fb37481f9f17c485ed828958a913d7ee94ba2837d61a9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "253 Mass-Produced Apparel\nlooseness, or overall fit.

The men\u2019s pants bunching \nissue in the front crotch was surprisingly less than the women\u2019s pants, which may have been a factor causing female paramedics to purchase men\u2019s pants. However, even though it was better, it was still a problem. This issue was clearly identified by examining the overlaid scans.\nAn example showing a female subject in the men\u2019s size 77R is shown in Figure 5.12 . \nThe near-nude scan by itself is shown at the upper left to help visualize the overlay. The overlaid scans are at the bottom right. Note the compression on the buttocks from the extremely tight back crotch and there is also bunching at the front from the front crotch being too long.\nThe same subject is shown in the men\u2019s size 82R in Figure 5.13 . Size 82 is more \ncomfortable in the back but less comfortable with more bunching in the front crotch. Neither size fits well.\nIt is important to try the subject in multiple sizes. Often the incorrect assumption is \nthat since the 77 was too tight the larger 82 will fit. This was not true in this case, as neither size fit well, but if forced to choose the size of best fit would be a 77. Further investigation by trying multiple sizes challenges the false underlying assumptions allowing the investigator to uncover the real problems.\nIt was determined that the women could achieve a good fit in the men\u2019s pro -\nportioned pants with the following modifications: (1) shorten the front crotch  \n14 mm at waist and 16 mm at crotch to remove bunching and allow forward bending,  \n(2) increase the back crotch 30 mm at the fork allowing a back length for squatting or add a stretch reinforced gusset, (3) keep the overall crotch length the same effec -\ntively moving the pant leg forward to ease pressure on the thigh when bending, and (4) slightly elasticize the front waist by using cotton/elastomeric fiber mix for the waistband to ease forward movement.\nFIGURE 5.12  Female paramedic in men\u2019s size 77R overlaid on near nude scan, Knight\u2019s \npose.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2234, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15e7aa1e-cdc2-4132-9ef6-c61ee27a5dd5": {"__data__": {"id_": "15e7aa1e-cdc2-4132-9ef6-c61ee27a5dd5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "256", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cebcb423-2947-4f45-ba7d-b6ad4771c77c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "256", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "24c95f2783817bac7f1cdf4e0d419939ba4b7dc3de0e720f7abc6648cc19c0ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "256 Product Fit and Sizing\nThese changes might not work for men.

A Law Enforcement Officer (LEO) procurement department wanted to know \nwhat sizes of body armor vests to purchase. They had an existing database that included some anthropometric measurements and which size vest each officer was allocated when they were recruited and fitted out by the manufacturer. They wanted to use their existing data to predict which sizes to buy. This assumes that the size allocated and fitted out by the manufacturer fits them. An analysis of the data indicated that many of them likely did not fit according to the COF. Therefore, either the COF is wrong or many of the officers had large unprotected areas with the body armor they were wearing. The COF was established by the National Institute of Justice. Therefore, not complying with this guide raises the question about the safety of the officers wearing the current body armor.\nThe ideal process should have been:\n1. Develop a COF\n2. Pilot test the COF\n3. Exploring which LEO body dimensions are important for product assessment\n4. Assemble or obtain a TP database anthropometry\n5.

We were brought in after the purchase deci -\nsion for which company\u2019s body armor to purchase, and after they had already done \na survey that did not include a fit assessment. They only collected the designation of \nthe size allocated, presumably the size of best fit, with no quality of fit score. So, if it \ndidn\u2019t fit or if it fit poorly that was not recorded. They included only three body mea -\nsurements and that did not include height and weight which made the data hard to \ncompare to other surveys that have 3D scan data for visualization, such as CAESAR \n(Blackwell et al., 2002 ; Robinette et al., 2002 ). Finally, there was no time or money \nallotted for fit testing, so this survey was all we had, and no live subjects were used.\nInputs\nThe COF was obtained from the National Institute of Justice\u2019s body armor guide \n(NIJ, 2014 ). It indicated that the armor front length should extend from just below \nthe jugular notch (1.75 cm below) to no more than 2\u20133 finger widths (about 5 cm) \nabove the officer\u2019s omphalion (belly button) when standing. The unstated and \nuntrue assumption is that the officer\u2019s duty belt and omphalion are located in the \nsame place. The intention is that this clearance allows for the shortening of the \nfront length of the body when a LEO sits. In the field of anthropometry, the jugular \nnotch is the top of the sternum and is also called Suprasternale. The location of \nthe duty belt is the preferred waist as described by Blackwell et al. (2002) . The \nmeasurement on the body from Suprasternale to the preferred waist in the front is \ncalled Waist Front Length.\nThe NIJ guide also indicated the vest should not interfere with the LEO\u2019s ability \nto shoot in their preferred stance and at the same time provide good coverage in the \narmhole area. The standing and shooting stance meant that the Interscye measure -\nment was likely significant. References to the number of acceptable overlaps at the \nside (although this is adjustable with Velcro) were associated with circumferences of \nthe waist and chest. The neck opening was associated with both neck circumference \nand the location of the neck in relation to the armhole.\nFor the TP, the LEO survey had data on 4000 new recruits (both male and female \nalthough this analysis is for males only). The data were collected by the manufac -\nturer of the existing vest. The data recorded were:\n\u2022 Chest Circumference\n\u2022 Waist Circumference at Omphalion (belly button)\n\u2022 Waist Front Length, Standing (to Omphalion)\n\u2022 Size of Existing Vest worn\nThere was no data on interscye, bust point to bust point or neck measurements \nso these aspects of the NIJ COF could not be examined from the LEO data alone. \nAlso, since the waist location used for the waist measurements was the Omphalion \nlandmark, we did not have the duty belt location either. The duty belt waist loca -\ntion is the preferred waist for their belt.

There were a few men who needed \nthe larger sizes 72 and 76, but there were no specifications for those sizes.\nWe added 6.75 cm to the length values to match the garment lengths to the body \nlength (Waist Front Length) that would be deemed a fit. That is adding 1.75 cm to move it up to the Suprasternale, and 5 cm to move it down to the duty belt. These values are shown in Table 5.8 .\nSurprisingly, even though the vest came in three lengths, the range of vest lengths \nwas only 5 cm. That is less than one-third of the body Waist Front Length 95% range. To visualize the impact, we examined the vest lengths from shortest to longest for each size which were then overlaid on a bivariate chart of the size worn by the LEOs by Waist Front Length in Figure 5.17 .\nNone of the men wore the smallest two sizes. For all sizes, there were some men for \nwhom the longest vest was too short. This gets worse as the size gets larger. Of those men who wore the sizes 64 and 68, more than half had a vest that was too short, meaning they did not have the torso coverage indicated as needed in the COF. In size 64, the gap in coverage was as much as 12.9 cm and for size 69 it was up to more than 10 cm. There were also problems with the vest being too long. When it is too long, it presents problems when sitting or crouching, pushing the vest up into the neck. Sizes 52 and 56 were the worst for this problem with the vest being as much as 7.5 cm too long in the 52 and as much as 10 cm too long in the 56. This indicated that the range of lengths was too nar -\nrow.

This was a clear indication that the grade was off. This vest has missed the fit sweet spot.\nThe combination of the range being too narrow and the grade being off-center  \nmeant that the percentage of men who met the COF was only approximately 30\u201340% of the LEO male population. If the COF was accurate this meant this was the approx -\nimate percentage who would get a safe and effective fit in the current set of sizes.\nFixing the grade alone would increase the percentage fit to as much as 75%, pro -\nvided it is the rigid ballistic plate that is graded and not just the fabric. This is probably a large source of the problem. Changing the ballistic plate is expensive and there is a tendency to want to use the same plate size for every garment size. The manufacturers who use one plate for every size can probably provide a cheaper proposal or offer, but poor protection and performance. The degradation in performance and safety might not be noticed unless the product is evaluated for protection coverage.\nCreating three to five plate lengths that are each 5 cm apart should provide more \nplate options to help fit the center area represented by the average grade line for each size. This will also increase the percentage of men who get a fit according to the NIJ \nCOF, and who will have a more comfortable fit as well. However, since the NIJ COF \nhas never been validated or evaluated on live subjects we do not really know that it is a good definition of safe and effective fit. To ensure a safe and effective fit, a fit audit is needed, with testing on live subjects representing the LEO population.\nFIGURE 5.17  Short to long vest sizes by width size.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1860, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3ce3007-229d-46b3-8ba0-966398f9d67f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3ce3007-229d-46b3-8ba0-966398f9d67f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "262", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a91f2ed2-a4e5-4ad7-b57e-a5ae23e4d629", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "262", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "ff127c074adb268b87944a7ce3d18820514420d534ba028182cb24593c2657aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "262 Product Fit and Sizing\nCase stuDy 4: p Rototype  test to DeteRmIne the CoRReCt aLteRatIon\nThis is a practical example based on an actual problem from a womenswear apparel \ncompany in the 1990s in Melbourne Australia. It illustrates how customer complaints \ncan be investigated to determine and fix an underlying problem in the fit standard.\nThe apparel company was a very well-known and respected family-run company \nthat had been in business since the 1960s. It had experienced sustained growth, espe -\ncially during the 1990s, producing millions of garments annually both under its own \nbrand names and under the private labels for large Australian department stores like \nMyer, Target, and David Jones. The company was very successful and achieved acco -\nlades from the department stores of preferred manufacturer status and was rightly \nproud of its reputation for quality. When working for itself, the company was vertically \nintegrated and had control over its brand identity. When working for the large depart -\nment stores it acted as both PD and production, with the cost of PD being recouped \nduring the production phase once it had secured orders. This distribution of the cost of \nPD was standard in the Australian industry at that time. It meant the company took a \nrisk every time it developed a style \u2013 if it didn\u2019t sell, the company would lose money \u2013 \nso the pressure was on the technical team to do a good job, fast, first time, every time!\nThe job of the pattern maker directly involved not just making the patterns, but \nalso overseeing and approving the sample-making and producing technical specifica -\ntions, while at the same time thinking about how the company could save money dur -\ning future production, solving any technical problems that arose in the most cost- and \nprofit-oriented way possible. This was comparable to a product engineering position. \nThe quality of these solutions directly affected the company\u2019s profitability. The com -\npany made a lot of money and was doing very well; however, it still had problems.\nIn the 1980s and 90s, almost all the garments made by this apparel company had \nshoulder pads. The trend going into the 2000s was that shoulder pads got smaller \nand then they were removed. When a garment has shoulder pads the armhole is big -\nger and correspondingly the sleeve is wider. Removing the shoulder pads allowed \nthe sleeve widths to narrow. This then caused a new problem when some customers \nreported that several different styles had tight sleeves in a size 16 (large size ladies \nwear). The patternmakers were asked to investigate it and solve this problem. In this \ncase study we compare what they did then and its result with how it could have been \nsolved if they had known about and used the procedures in this book.\nStandard practice in the company was to produce a base size (bust measurement \n90 cm) and grade the pattern based on x and y coordinates to produce the other sizes \nautomatically. It used the then state-of-the-art newly emerged computer technology for \nthis. The grading was the 50 mm bust grade. The sleeve was graded 12 mm per size, as \nwas consistent with what was taught in fashion design school in Australia in the 1980s.\nThe company always checked the fit of the base size with a garment sample on \na manikin and a fit model, both which represented their unverified fit standard. The \nfit model was knowledgeable about the implicit fit expected and knew how to check \nthe functionality of the garments. Once the sample was approved and sold to the \ncustomer there was no further checking of the sewn garments for fit.\nAll sizes were subject to quality assurance procedures, but these only involved \nmaking sure the sewn garment matched the specifications listed in the \u201cspec\u201d \nsheet. For example, they would check to ensure that the pocket was in the correct", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3858, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8954a07-932e-44c6-a51c-8fc662ce9222": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8954a07-932e-44c6-a51c-8fc662ce9222", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "263", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5f4aba67-1bd5-4df4-9cc4-75fc733badf1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "263", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "0e0293a2e286a31db6aa0e397da3eff57423a9ef1080b776b7977c60173d00f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "263 Mass-Produced Apparel\nlocation. Millions of garments were cut, sewn, and sold. The only feedback the \ncompany had was from the retail sales figures. This meant they were acutely aware \nof \u201cbest-sellers\u201d and so they developed variations on these styles, slavishly hoping \nto have more best-sellers. This often worked and made the company more money.\nIt was in this environment that the company received feedback from some retail -\ners suggesting the sleeve was too tight in the upper arm for some of the ladies who \nneeded larger sizes, in particular those ladies wishing to buy a size 16. The retailers \nalso suggested a solution. They asked the technical team in the company to increase \nthe sleeve in the base size to fix this problem. The technical team was immediately \nconcerned that the proposed solution would cause a cascade of other problems. If the \ntechnical team accepted the suggestion, they had to decide what to do with the extra \nlength in the sleeve head. The sleeve needed to be sewn into the armhole, so should \nthey make the armhole bigger or add more ease? Also, if it was a problem for that \nstyle what about all the other similar or future styles? Did they need to be \u201cfixed\u201d in \nthe same way? If not, why not?\nThis was the mid-1990s and coming out of the 1980s all the styles had shoulder \npads. This extra length in the armhole (to fit the shoulder pad) meant the sleeves \nwere already wide. The design team was nervous and reluctant to make them \nwider, especially as the emerging trend was for smaller shoulder pads and narrower \nsleeves. Remember back then there was no anthropometric data on the Australian \nTP and the idea of testing was not anything the company management understood. \nBoth the design and the patternmaking teams were uncertain about what to do.\nThe patternmakers had two choices. Either do what was asked or ignore the \nrequest. Arguments flowed both ways around the pattern room and in the design, \nproduction, and management teams. On the one hand, the company wanted to please \nthe customers and do the right thing to improve the product. On the other hand, \neveryone, including retail, was happy with the existing base size sleeve. It looked \ngood and they had been getting a steady stream of approvals and subsequent sales.\nIf the company made the base size sleeve bigger it would look wrong. This \nwould have introduced a considerable risk of reducing the number of sales in the \nmost frequently selling sizes which would not have been offset by any increase in \nsales in size 16. In addition, it would have caused a cascade of the technical prob -\nlems described above. Utmost in people\u2019s minds was how any change would play \nout in the mass production setting. Clearly, more ease in the sleeve head would \nbe unacceptable, as the bigger the ease allowance, the more skilled the sewing \nmachinist needed to be, as this was a more difficult sewing task. The production \nmanager would say no immediately. More ease meant more fails at the quality \ncontrol point and the need for a higher-paid, more skilled workforce. The company \nneeded to manage all these factors. The patternmaker was the person oversee -\ning, doing, and coordinating pattern changes, and was ultimately responsible for \nany increase in the cost of production. Juggling all these factors the patternmaker \nneeded a very good argument at hand to justify any major changes with cost rami -\nfications. To say that they were \u201ctold to do it\u201d would not have been good enough. \nSo, with all this in mind, after much discussion the pattern room personnel told \nretail they would look at it, which they did; and then the final decision was to do \nnothing . The only downside was it did not solve the reported problem of the sleeves \nbeing too tight in the size 16 garments.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3792, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fd03d4f-84eb-47b7-98ca-291565faa4d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fd03d4f-84eb-47b7-98ca-291565faa4d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "264", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4d96a6fd-e059-457c-9297-4e93a3535f01", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "264", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "fc15d5d9384981924e1457de50b9554ea856acc5b46481667b73a46409f19f04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "264 Product Fit and Sizing\nFast Forward 30 Years\u2026\nWhat measurements, tests and analysis methods could be used in the current envi -\nronment with current knowledge to solve this problem? Are there any extra benefits \nto using these methods?\nIt turns out now there was a third choice: check body growth in each size against \nthe base size and grading. This was not an option at that time for the company; even if they had known how to do it, they didn\u2019t have any anthropometric data, certainly none that represented the population. But it is an option now. This is what the patternmaker could do now if asked to solve that problem.\nSolution: Map the base size and grade against the TP.First, select a sample to represent the TP then select relevant measurements such \nas those shown in Figure 5.18  (Upper Arm Circumference and Bust Circumference), \nand compare the grade to the TP distribution as in Figure 5.19 .\nThen calculate average arm measurements per size using linear regression as \ndescribed in Chapter 3 . The arm measurements in Table 5.9  were calculated using a \nlinear regression equation y = 0.35x\u201328.47 where x is the Bust measurement and y is the Upper Arm Circ. For size 10 the Upper Arm Circ. = \u201328.47 +  0.35 * 900 which \nequals 286.53 mm (rounded). Extra benefits included being able to identify any miss -\ning sizes and determine the tariffs.\nThe number of subjects in a size was estimated by dividing the sizes into Bust \nCircumference size ranges and counting them. By examining the number and per -\ncentage of subjects per size, as in Table 5.10 , we see where potential sales might be. \nThis is very useful for determining the cut ratios. This would need adjustment if the company decided it would not produce sizes 6 and 4, which was true for the historical example used.\nFIGURE 5.18  Two relevant measurements.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1837, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64899276-3683-48ca-80c7-1486c2cbcb34": {"__data__": {"id_": "64899276-3683-48ca-80c7-1486c2cbcb34", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "265", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7bf40534-0aa5-4e90-aedf-3a3fe3ccbeac", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "265", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "6e20857d594c82be96a3b6b9e4bce233731dbc2ee491a66582fac916006f106a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "265 Mass-Produced Apparel\nFIGURE 5.19  Existing grade versus ideal grade.\nTABLE 5.9\nSubjects Sorted According to Bust Sizes to Calculate an Average Arm Girth per Size\nAU SizeBust Mid. \n(mm)Bust Min. \n(mm)Bust Max. \n(mm)No. of \nSubj.Actual \nArmSleeve \nGrowth ErrorCumulative  \nGrade Error\n750 725 775 22\n6 800 776 825 164 252 \u201312 5 Slv 11 mm too big\n8 850 826 875 328 269 \u201312 6 Slv 6 mm too big\n10 900 876 925 318 287 0 0 0 mm (base size)\n12 950 926 975 157 304 12 6 Slv 6 mm too small\n14 1000 976 1025 68 322 12 6 Slv 12 mm too small\n16 1050 1026 1075 22 339 12 6 Slv 18 mm too small\nTABLE 5.10Percentages in Each Size\nSize Frequency Percent Cumulative Percent\n4 22 2.0 2.0\n6 164 15.2 17.2\n8 328 30.4 47.6\n10 318 29.5 77.1\n12 157 14.6 91.7\n14 68 6.3 98.0\n16 22 2.0 100.0\nTotal 1079 100.0", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 787, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e3cd301-82ae-4b50-950f-36b7b6b8a0a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e3cd301-82ae-4b50-950f-36b7b6b8a0a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "266", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "479608e0-4b05-42da-b934-46d1913745be", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "266", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "07f1c00917e8bd090b2fedaaf22921d93f55c7db6c378da5df8778346b912e86", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "266 Product Fit and Sizing\nIn the apparel industry, the pattern piece is shown by its shape, and the grade, \nmarked in both x and y directions is shown in mm on the pattern piece in the location \nof the graded increment. In Figure 5.20 , where there is a 10 and 8 marked, they add \nup to an 18 mm sleeve grade in the x-direction (sleeve width). In addition, there is a 5 mm grade in the sleeve height below the head and a 5 mm grade in the head height making the total grade in the y-direction 10 mm. This summary of the grade allows the garment growth (sleeve width of 18 mm) to be seen immediately.\nGrading practices have changed over the years. The use of the computer has allowed \ngrading to become more advanced. This change in the sleeve grade from 12 mm to 18 mm per size is now Australia\u2019s most used sleeve grade increment. When grading follows the body growth it is sometimes referred to as allometric or 3D grading. In addition, different companies use different grades, and they are often proprietary and that is part of their fit standard.\nDiscussion\nThe correct fix that the technical team missed in the 1990s was a grading problem. \nSpecifically, the sleeve growth mismatch to arm growth made the sleeve progres -\nsively tighter for each size we graded. The technical team\u2019s decision to do nothing was the best decision they could have made at the time; however, it did not fix the problem. The problem was not a problem of a single size but a systematic problem that affected all sizes. The wide sleeve 80s styling with shoulder pads concealed the grading issue. The problem only emerged in the 90s because the styling was chang -\ning, shoulder pads were getting smaller or being removed and the trend was toward tighter, more slim-fitting sleeves.\nThe base size did not need to change and if they had followed advice from retail \nand changed the base size that would have caused a cascade of problems and been very bad for business. Current analysis and techniques using data representing the TP allow informed solutions with minimal risk in terms of time or money. The solu -\ntion was to leave the base size as is and fix the grade. This would have improved sales in the size 16. As an incidental finding, when we mapped the bust sizes against the TP, we learned we should have added a size 6 and potentially picked up an additional 15% in market share.\nFIGURE 5.20  Sleeve with grading marked in mm.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2417, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94620c58-38a8-40ff-8cee-ea15d50d3278": {"__data__": {"id_": "94620c58-38a8-40ff-8cee-ea15d50d3278", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "267", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b7c8656b-a693-42ed-8639-5de18b89a9af", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "267", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "12f5f283d76624796a120cdc436d93d796a943663e7f902a2e439587458015cd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "267 Mass-Produced Apparel\nAlthough the Company had a \u201cfit standard\u201d that fit standard was never verified. \nThe best practice is to use the SPEED process to fit test best-selling garments in their \nfull size range to establish any issues in individual fit, the range of fit in a size, and \nthe best fit for the TP.

The head and face area are home to all five of the human sensory organs: the eyes, the nose, the tongue, the ears, and the skin. In addition, the head houses the brain, one of the most important vital organs. It is therefore understandable that products designed to protect, enhance, or monitor human sensory performance or status are head and face worn. Furthermore, head and face-worn products are more likely than products in other areas to require being located within a small proximity of the sensory organs, especially the eyes and ears. This means head and face wearable design has special challenges. This chapter discusses the challenges and how to best accommodate them using the sustain-able product evaluation, engineering, and design process (SPEED) approach.\nBACKGROUND\nHead wearables today are much more complex than they were just a 100 years ago. As a result, unlike fashion apparel and footwear, very few consistent or established sizing systems exist for headwear products. A lot of these products are so unique in their applications that their product sizing will need to be done from scratch. In addi -\ntion, unlike fabric apparel discussed in Chapter 5 , many products worn on the head \nand face have rigid or molded material components. Examples include biking or motorcycle helmets, full- or half-face protective masks, oxygen masks, headphones, eyeglasses, AR/VR headsets, helmets with heads-up displays, etc. Some of these products also include complex and sensitive electronics that need to enhance the human experience or performance by interfacing with the human senses and abilities (most commonly vision, speech, and hearing).\nWith all the sensory organs located in this area, head wearables must often inter -\nface with other head wearables. For example, helmets may have to interface with masks, earphones, glasses, etc. All these items have their specific fit issues and fit testing criteria and sometimes have competing requirements. As a result, fit assess -\nment for many head wearables must include the complex fit of an ensemble of head worn items. Performance metrics for the ensemble and for the individual compo -\nnents can be very important for inclusion into the Concept-of-Fit (COF) metrics. Examples of performance metrics include:\n\u2022 CB mask leakage (particle count reduction)\n\u2022 Real-world visibility6\nThis chapter has been made available under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2743, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "446fa3bc-cee7-4253-80a3-fd63ac8d7d9d": {"__data__": {"id_": "446fa3bc-cee7-4253-80a3-fd63ac8d7d9d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "269", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5e94a3e7-748b-4f36-9246-e401635deb3d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "269", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "30ea3d43f28c9b3ad8d7f57fc5af9a74164e3d01fd0d8a08cf3a6e24c8ea8c5a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "269 Head and Face Wearables\n\u2022 Virtual field of view\n\u2022 Eye tracking performance\n\u2022 Noise attenuation\n\u2022 Speech intelligibility\n\u2022 Slippage or stability\nMost performance metrics cannot be measured without testing with human sub -\njects for two key reasons. First, neither digital human models nor physical manikins \nhave all the physical properties of real people therefore they do not sense things like \nreal people. For example, we can measure temperature, but we cannot determine the \ntemperature that is uncomfortable without testing on people. Also, since we do not \nknow how tight is tight enough and how tight is too tight, the assessment of slippage \nand stability is impossible without a human subject in the loop. Second, the some -\nwhat spherical shape of the head, the paucity of reliable landmarks in the cranial \nregion, and the large random variability of the landmarks on the face make it impos -\nsible to accurately determine the location of the wearable and the other interfacing \ncomponents in the ensemble on any individual without donning a prototype.\nFor example, the F-35 helmet must be worn with noise attenuation earcups and an \noxygen mask. These items must be positioned correctly to work properly and cannot \ninterfere with the helmet-mounted display. Webster reported that the oxygen mask can \nbe located too close to the visor such that it bends the visor and distorts the display, or \nit can be too far away resulting in leakage that prevents proper oxygen flow ( Webster, \n2021). During fitting, pilots are sent to an oxygen tester where technicians identify leaks \nand ensure proper mask fit when the pilot moves or talks. This type of testing when \ndone early in the design process helps us avoid costly re-designs late in the process.\nThe SPEED process employs human testing early in the design process with itera -\ntive trade studies and design loop testing to ensure the final product meets all perfor -\nmance requirements. We discuss the issues and how to resolve them in this chapter \nwith examples in the case studies section.\nHead wearables have constraints that are not directly related to the purpose of the \nproduct but may result in impacts on the function of the other sensory organs. As a \nresult, there can be many fit factors to be considered in addition to the ones that sat -\nisfy the purpose of the product. This factor can make a fit assessment more compli -\ncated. For example, a protective mask may need to be worn with eyeglasses without \ncausing them to fog up. The eyeglasses are not part of the protective mask design, but \nthey should be included as part of the fit assessment. It is important to consider the \nimpact of the entire system when planning head wearable testing.\nFor protective masks that need to filter out hazardous materials, special equipment to \nmeasure leakage might be needed. Case et al. (1989)  used a test chamber, the Dynatech \nFrontier Portable Fit Testing System 1000, for testing a chemical and biological protec -\ntive mask, the MCU-2/P. This system measured the amount of challenge agent (corn oil \nmist) that leaked into the masks. A proper seal is an important fit factor in this case. The \nfit test led to the discovery that the way masks were being issued may have been flawed, \nby providing masks that were too large resulting in undesirable leakage.\nFor head wearables, movement, and even facial expressions can impact fit and \nfunction, so fit measurements should include activities the wearer might be expected", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3502, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4de49d6-3f66-4c02-a038-29494007b2c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4de49d6-3f66-4c02-a038-29494007b2c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "270", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e4735ac3-90c2-4e18-bc57-17b4ff61e4d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "270", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "6571b4df635de0d76d75ec198d34cb01474771b1d2f24fa659baf3766cb8aaeb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "270 Product Fit and Sizing\nto do while wearing it.

Weight applied far away from the center of mass (COM) of the head causes a larger moment and therefore higher strain on the neck, which could result in neck pain and injury, as illustrated in Figure 6.1 . Moment (M) is a function of the amount of vertical force ( F) or \nFIGURE 6.1  Moment around COM on head.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1316, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5830cfd5-2ab6-4ef2-b7c3-2aea8e4a6b9a": {"__data__": {"id_": "5830cfd5-2ab6-4ef2-b7c3-2aea8e4a6b9a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "271", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "11f7fbc5-f22b-4a5c-8aa2-39b7af4d48bf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "271", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "6e1d7fc3dca0cd9ae74661f39fb836097435168b6e43ed5d329d82014b500461", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "271 Head and Face Wearables\nweight applied, and the perpendicular distance ( d) to the center of rotation. In this fig -\nure, we keep F and \u019f the same, one Newton and 90 degrees respectively, but we increase \nthe distance ( D) between the object and the COM of the head, and show its effect on \nM. It\u2019s clear that by just moving the object further away from the head COM, increases \nthe amount of moment on then neck proportionally. This means if we add weight to \nthe wearable in front of the eyes, such as when we add heavy lenses or displays, it will \ncause more neck strain than it would if we added the weight closer to the head COM, \nsuch as around the ears. The increased moment also increases instability and slippage \nduring movement. Asymmetrical weight distribution can also cause fatigue, pain and/\nor injury due to uneven loading of the neck. Therefore, head wearables will most likely \nhave to take weight distribution into account in the requirements and COF.\nSENSITIVITY TO TEMPERATURE\nAnother important issue for head worn products is the particular sensitivity to tem -\nperature on the head and face. Several studies have suggested thermal discomfort to \nbe a reason for persons not wanting to wear protective headgear ( Li et al., 2008 ; Patel \n& Mohan, 1993 ; Skalkidou et al., 1999 ). A lower rate of motorcycle helmet use has \nbeen reported between the north and south of Italy (93% versus 60% respectively), \nsupposedly due to higher rates of thermal discomfort in the warmer southern climate \n(Servadei, 2003 ). Options to increase user comfort could include special textiles such \nas phase change materials ( Tiest et al., 2012 ) or increase ventilation, which enhances \nboth convective cooling and seat evaporation ( Alam et al., 2010 ; Bogerd et al., 2015 ; \nMukunthan et al., 2019a ,b). The skin plays a fundamental role in the thermoregula -\ntion function to maintain the core body temperature around 37 \u00b0C. If the whole body \nor local areas of the body becomes \u201ctoo hot\u201d, blood flow is increased through the \ndermis (vasodilation) to release heat through the epidermis to the environment. If \ngreater heat loss is required, the surface of the skin is moistened with sweat so that \nthe latent heat of vaporization may be lost through evaporation ( Meyer et al., 2002 ). \nIn warm environments, evaporation of sweat is the main heat loss pathway ( Bogerd \net al., 2015 ). Local sweat rates at the head correlated significantly with whole body \nsweat rate ( Bain et al., 2011 ) and varied spatially with higher sweat rates reported at \nthe forehead compared to the temple, vertex, and rear regions ( Cabanac & Brinnel, \n2000 ; Machado-Moreira et al., 2008 ; Smith & Havenith, 2011 ). Local differences in \nthermal sensitivities of the head\u2019s surface have furthermore been observed, with the \nforehead seen to be typically more sensitive than the sides of the scalp ( Mehrabyan \net al., 2011 ).\nDuring the design phase, several designs could be evaluated for thermal comfort \nas one of the objective fit criteria using thermal computational simulation models or \nphysical thermal head forms. The application of anatomically formed thermal mani -\nkin head forms provides information about combined heat and mass transfer with \nand without the use of headgear. Several such simulation models and head forms \nhave been developed. Examples include work published by Abeysekera et al. (1991) , \nBandmann et al. (2018) , Ellis (2003) , Hsu et al. (2000) , Liu and Holm\u00e9r (1995a) , \nMukunthan et al. (2019a ,b), Osczevski (1996) , and Reid and Wang (2000) .

Thermal manikin head forms are equipped \nwith heating elements and temperature sensors. The surface temperature of the head \nform is typically regulated at a fixed temperature, and the total power needed to maintain this temperature over a steady-state period is recorded. This heating power equals the total net heat transfer, which allows the quantification of combined heat loss by convection, conduction, and radiation. To quantify the individual heat trans -\nfer pathways, measurements must be carried out with conditions allowing only a par -\nticular heat transfer pathway while preventing the other pathways. The heat transfer pathway is then quantified by calculating the heat transfer differences between the different conditions.\nOf course, these devices can measure the temperature, but they cannot tell us \nwhat temperatures are comfortable. We need human subjects for that. However, if we have both we can correlate comfort with temperature in a particular headwear ensemble to help us design the product.\nHEAD ORIENTATION AND ALIGNMENT\nThe somewhat spherical shape of the head presents stability, slippage, orientation, and alignment challenges that are not issues for other areas of the body. While the nose and the ears provide some anchor points for a wearable, they are small, soft, and very sensitive to weight and pressure, so it is rare for these to be good anchor points for anything other than very lightweight wearables. As some of us know, even heavy eyeglass lenses can make them painful to wear. For comfort and stability, it is usually better to fit snugly to the cranium rather than the nose or ears. Hair type is an additional variable that influences slippage and stability. Including objective and subjective metrics evaluating slippage and stability in the fit metrics for head wearables are regularly needed.\nHowever, the most difficult challenge is determining the orientation and align -\nment of the head for measurement, shape analysis, and/or product design. This is predominantly due to the head not having a clear long axis such as the whole body, arms, legs, or even feet. In addition, the neck anatomy enables a large range of motion: flexion, extension, and rotation.\nHead orientation is defined as the head rotation around the x-, y-, or z-axes also \nreferred to as pitch, roll or yaw (see Figure 6.2 ). A challenge for head wearables is \nthat many different head orientations can be chosen and none of them may coincide with the axis system of the wearable (how the wearable is worn on the head).\nUnder certain conditions, the orientation of the head is not important or applicable. \nThis includes the analysis of 1D measurements which does not incorporate head ori -\nentation information, such as Head breadth, Head length, Face length, Face breadth, Bi-Tragion breadth, Nose width, Mouth width, or even linear distances between", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3278, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc38f36a-d6b7-40ee-8daf-2da7adbae151": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc38f36a-d6b7-40ee-8daf-2da7adbae151", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "273", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "14be4515-974b-440a-b1c0-427b7642edb9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "273", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "250cb531778aa31d8db2e33ea8954df5bfc733ca294f89acea16c98574ec6c9f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "273 Head and Face Wearables\nlandmarks such as Glabella to Tragion, or Sellion to Pronasale, etc. However, mea -\nsurements that incorporate orientation information such as the horizontal fore-aft \ndistance from Tragion to Glabella (only in the z-direction), or Tragion-to-top of the head (vertical measurement, only in the y-direction), etc. are impacted strongly by the head orientation. Therefore, if such measurements are key to the function of the product and must be used for size/shape variance understanding and input to the design, then selecting the correct head orientation becomes very important. This was illustrated in Chapter 2 , Figure 2.5 , the point-of-view error illustration.

The position of the point in the vertical or horizontal axes is dependent on the pitch orientation of the head. In this illustration, the location of the landmark differs by more than 40 mm in the vertical direction from trial 2 to trial 3, even though this is the same subject.\nFor product design, the only correct alignment is the product alignment. This \nproblem is explained with many examples in the chapter on HMD displays by Whitestone and Robinette ( Melzer & Moffitt, 1996 ). Unfortunately, until we have \na mock-up or prototype to place on actual people, we do not know what this align -\nment truly is. Therefore, we must make an educated guess for our first prototype.

It is established by a horizontal line passing through the right Tragion (the \nfront of the ear) and the lowest point of the right eye socket\u201d. This definition has been widely adopted in the field of Anthropometry, such as by the International Standards for Anthropometry Assessment (ISAK, 2001), by the International Standards Organization Anthropometry technical committee in the 3D scanning methodolo -\ngies for international compatible anthropometric databases Part 1 ( ISO 20685-1 , \n2018), the Korean National Anthropometry survey ( https//sizeKorea.kr ), Japanese \nhead anthropometry survey ( Kouchi & Mochimaru, 2004 ), South African National \nDefense Force Anthropometry survey ( RSA-MIL-STD 127 Vol 1, 2005 ), and the \nUnited States of America Army Anthropometry survey ( Gordon et al., 1989 , 2012 ), \nto name a few. This definition does however leave some space for interpretation. As used by ISAK, the head is viewed from the right side and neck flexed/extended so that the right Tragion landmark at the ear is on the same horizontal plane as the right Infraorbitale landmark. No head yaw or rotation is addressed, therefore assuming that whatever natural asymmetry or yaw is present when the participant originally positions his/her head, would still remain. ISO 20685-1 (2018) defines the Frankfurt plane as the head pitched such that the right Infraorbitale landmark below the eye is on the same horizontal plane as the right Tragion landmark, and that the head is yawed such that the right and left Tragion landmarks are on a horizontal plane. However, as we learned when we began measuring in 3D, the right and left Tragion landmarks are not necessarily symmetric, therefore aligning the head with right and left Tragions on the same horizontal plane, could cause other points on the face to be out of alignment for areas important to the specific product being designed for. For instance, the right and left eyes might now not be on the same plane which could be a requirement for AR/VR or other products designed around the eye. The midline of the face might not be aligned to the vertical, which could be a requirement for products designed around the nose and mouth.\nDuring the SizeChina-Hunan head scanning project, after data collection, the \nhead scans were digitally processed during which each head scan was rotated and translated into the Frankfurt plane. With the x-axis running through the left and right Tragion landmarks, the origin midway between the left and right Tragion, and a positive direction towards the right Tragion. The X/Y plane passed through the left and right Tragion and left Infraorbitale landmarks. Positive y-direction anteriorly, and positive z-direction upwards ( Luximon et al., 2015 ; Wang et al., 2018 ).\nPark et al. (2020) aligned 180 3D head scans to create a parametric adult head \nmodel with representation of scalp shape variability. These head models were aligned in the Frankfurt plane for statistical analysis. The coordinate system was defined with the origin midway between the left and right Tragion, the y-axis run -\nning through right and left Tragion landmarks. The X/Y plane passed through the left and right Tragion and left Infraorbitale landmarks. The z-axis is a cross product of x- and y-axes, running vertically.\nNiezgoda and Zhuang (2015) analyzed the shape variance of approximately 4000 \nhead scans of the United States Civilian population to create head forms for ISO Eye \nand Face Protection Standards. To analyze the variance of the head and face shape \nand sizes, Niezgoda and Zhuang (2015)  aligned all heads in the Frankfurt plane. \nSimilarly, Yu et al.

It leads to a very odd shaped model that is not representative of anyone.\nBadawi-Fayad and Cabanis (2007)  took advantage of 3D imaging and digitization \ntechniques and recommended using 3D Procrustes superimposition  as a method of \ndetermining head orientation and alignment. Procrustes superimposition is an itera -\ntive least-square adjustment of all the figures after size normalization. It includes \nthree phases: scaling, translation, and rotation. The skulls are scaled to have the same \nsize, they are translated to have their geometrical centers fit exactly with one another, \nand finally rotated to minimize the gaps between anatomical points. Badawi-Fayad \nand Cabanis used the x, y, and z coordinates of 33 anatomical landmark points as \ninput to the Procrustes alignment. While this was better than using the Frankfurt \nPlane it still results in oddly shaped cranial regions that are not representative of real \npeople because nearly all the reliable anatomical landmarks are on the face and they \nare not evenly distributed.\nGeneralized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) was employed as head orientation align -\nment for the development of Statistical head models for facial animation by research -\ners such as Dai et al. (2020)  and Li et al. (2017) . Since most landmarks that are \npalpable or recognizable are on the face this has a strong bias for the face. For facial \nanimation or for facial recognition this may be a reasonable approach. However, for \nproduct design it does not reflect how the product will be worn and the product will \nhave different location biases.\nFor an AR/VR headset, where the product alignment in relation to the eye and \nline of sight is important for product fit and function, a head orientation deemed \nthe \u201cNeutral gaze\u201d was used. The Neutral gaze  pitch angle for each individual was \ndetermined during the 3D head data capture (scanning) phase. During the 3D head \ndata capture phase, each individual\u2019s head was positioned in an approximate neutral \nand relaxed orientation. The procedure included: each user was positioned on a chair \nwithout a backrest, with both feet resting comfortably approximately hip distance \napart on the floor and knees flexed at approximately 90 degrees. Each participant \nwas instructed to sit upright with their shoulders relaxed back and down. They were \nthen instructed to stretch the neck by looking up at the roof, and down at their chest, \nthen looking right, looking left, and bending the neck first to the right (as if attempt -\ning to touch the right ear to the right shoulder) and then to the left. Then finally, par -\nticipants were requested to sit upright again with shoulders relaxed back and down, \nand to look at themselves in a mirror set up perfectly vertical approximately 1.5 m \nin front of them. The problem with neutral gaze positioning is repeatability, as there \nis no control for the participants to position their head in exactly the same position \neach time. Reliability testing indicated that the pitch angles could range as much as \n\u00b16 degrees within one individual positioning his/her head repeatedly ( Schnieders \net al., 2023 ).\nAlmost similar to the neutral gaze head alignment, during the SizeChina-Hunan \n3D head anthropometry data collection, the head orientation of participants being", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3728, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fcfab1f-c5e6-4b8e-8285-a3a6b1aa0542": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fcfab1f-c5e6-4b8e-8285-a3a6b1aa0542", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "277", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5cbb064a-3412-460e-92ec-dd947ba3842e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "277", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "ca38ad61c533c857ac2030932212612cc773d6df1bc3bc31ff635e1245b37aa0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "277 Head and Face Wearables\nscanned was defined by participants being instructed to look at a fixed point marked \nin front of them ( Du et al., 2006 ; Luximon et al., 2015 ; Wang et al., 2018 ).

When 3D head scan data is col -\nlected, the scanner coordinate system will determine the origin of the data. The 3D \nscan origin, zero point for all three coordinate axes (x, y, and z), is normally deter -\nmined by the scanner calibration. Therefore, for some scanner systems, the origin \ncould even vary between different data collection days on one system.

These included: (1) the Principal Axis System (PrinAx), \n(2) an approximate corneal plane alignment (Eye), and (3) a top-of-head alignment (TopHead). For all three alignment frameworks, the head rotational orientation (pitch, roll, and yaw) was the same, with the main point of difference being the origin of the Cartesian system. The PrinAx method used all head surface points to define sur -\nface triangles. The area of each triangle was used to approximate mass distribution (assuming uniform density). Then, the center of mass and principal axes of inertia were calculated for each 3D head scan. The center of mass for all the triangles was used as the origin and the principal axes to define the x-, y-, and z-axes, or the three directions. The second and third methods begin with PrinAx to register all subjects together and establish the x, y, and z directions. The 3D head data was then translated to have an origin for all subjects at the midpoint between the right and left pupil for the second method (Eye) and at the top of the head for the third method (TopHead). The PrinAx method provides an orientation that uniformly distributes variability and is centered around an estimate of the center-of-gravity (cg) of the head which was believed to be a balance point for the head for biomechanical purposes. The Eye method was intended to simulate a pupil location restriction such as might occur for a helmet-mounted display. The TopHead method was intended to simulate a helmet resting position directly above the cg.

The TopHead method has less variability at the top and back of the head but the most variability in the face, both vertically and horizontally. Even though the three methods all begin with the same basic alignment there are substantial differences that will impact fit.\nA study was conducted to arrive at a head model for a Navy flight helmet used a \nsample size of 747 Navy pilots. They were all healthy and physically fit, and when they were selected for pilot training, they had no vision or hearing problems or physi -\ncal anomalies that might cause them fit or functioning problems. They also had to meet Stature and Sitting Height standards to ensure they could fit into and fly an aircraft. At the time the head data was collected there were no female Navy pilots, so the sample is all male. Since the US population at that time was only 1% Asian and many of those had Sitting Heights, Seated Eye Heights and Leg Lengths that were too short to operate aircraft controls there were few Asians who made it through flight training. In other words, this was a uniform population compared to the civil -\nian population.

For this, the heads were rotated (rolled and yawed) so that the right and left pupils were aligned on the same horizontal plane (since the headset will ideally be aligned to the eyes on a horizontal plane), with the x-axis passing through both pupils. The y-axis was pointing vertically upwards, and the z-axis towards the front. All 3D head data was then translated so that the origin of the coordinate system was at a point midway between the right and left pupil, 3\u00a0mm in front of the pupil position (to approximate the Corneal Apex position).

There is no generic axis alignment system that will align the head the way the product will be worn. A universally correct head orientation and alignment doesn\u2019t exist. Why is this important? It means we cannot effectively design for multiple people at one time without a product prototype, because we do not have enough information to overlay them properly. Different head models will be required for different head and face products. A \u201cuniversal\u201d head model in one set head alignment will most likely provide a false sense of head and face variance, since inevitably head orientation artifacts, such as forward-backward rotation (pitch), would not be applicable to how the product is worn.\nSo, we begin the design process by making educated guesses regarding how \nthe product will fit on the head of one or a few human cases and creating a mock-up to test on the live subjects and adjust our product orientation.

This understanding could be formulated through an informal, small-scale fit test of similar products. With the use of widely used software tools such as MATLAB or Excel, or software programming, 3D head data can be re-oriented to the desired head orientation and alignment with relative ease. After testing mock-ups on human subjects CAD software with reasonably accurate 3D representations of the human head can help us not only re-orient the product to the head but can help us track and document the changes as well to help us avoid repeating mistakes.\nFor technology products, such as audio/communication headphones or AR/VR \nheadsets, CAD is fundamental to the design process due to the complexity of inter -\nnal components included in the product design. For head-worn products requiring expensive manufacturing processes, such as molding, CAD furthermore enables the use of computer-controlled manufacturing or prototyping processes. Since the man -\nufacturing processes are usually costly and time intensive, optimizing the design to the human in the CAD space can help save time and money. The CAD file alone  will \nnot provide a reliable location for how the device actually  fits on the head, but when \nused together with mock-up and prototype assessment on human subjects it is a very powerful tool.\nFIGURE 6.6  Alignment of 10 head scans in \u201cNeutral Gaze\u201d around the eye for AR/VR type \nheadset.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1547, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "daccf959-ce9f-4544-8dc2-dbd6f6112ab9": {"__data__": {"id_": "daccf959-ce9f-4544-8dc2-dbd6f6112ab9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "281", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "808e0ddb-bb90-4f37-84f2-ae21b4528b05", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "281", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "db7a50beef12aa60ef29f05f768d31aac52de8ecf51044dfe128930dc368b8f0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "281 Head and Face Wearables\nDue to time constraints in the product development cycle, product manage -\nment teams regularly put a lot of pressure on human factors specialists and user \ntesting teams to reduce the time for actual fit testing. In the absence of these teams, the importance of fit testing is often deprioritized and \u201creplaced\u201d by CAD or physical head and face model fitting. This is a mistake that can result in the need for a complete re-design very late in the development process when changes are expensive and more time consuming. We will further highlight the risks associated with this approach and provide examples of how to overcome some of these challenges.\nHEAD ANTHROPOMETRY\nSince CAD is so valuable for the design and development of head wearables, we need to have good 3D anthropometry of the human head to import into our CAD systems. We also need good 1D anthropometry for characterizing, grouping, and analyzing fit data, as well as for selecting good cases.\nIt is important to keep in mind that, as we explained in Chapter 2 , the digital \nversion of the head that is compatible with CAD software is not an exact copy of the human head. Some file transformation is required from the original scan point cloud file to a format that can be imported into the engineering CAD software used for design. The modifications needed will depend on the engineering CAD software used.\nMost of the time, the file size of the original scan (could be as large as 20 \nMbytes) must be reduced to enable importing several head cases into a CAD file. File sizes can be reduced through decimation of the polygon structure or using software such as RS WRAP to create a uniform or homogenous polygon file. Files as small as 450 kB, with good enough resolution for use in design, are obtainable through this process. However, it is important to note that through the raw 3D scan cleaning and reduction process, the surface does not exactly match the original points.\nAnother area typically not well represented in the digital version of the human \nis the surface under hair. Although the differences between the digital version and the actual head could be reasonably small and insignificant, the differences on the scalp due to the hair are most likely very significant, especially for individuals with long hair and/or large hair volume. When capturing a 3D head scan, normally the user is prepared for the scan by placing a hair compressing cap over his/her hair. For persons with long hair, one method of scanning process regularly used is to have the participant tie the hair up in a high bun, place a hair compression cap over his/her hair, and tie off the hair bun with an elastic so that it\u2019s easier to identify and cut from the 3D data during post-processing. Even with the hair compression cap, dif -\nferences are still observed between the surface captured and the skull.

Park et al. (2020)  \npresented a database consisting of 80 bald scans of US Army males and 100 3D \nhead skull data for US Army females. The US Army female head data included \nscalp points probed with a FARO Arm touch probe (coordinate digitizer) through \nfour to five hair parts on each side of the midsagittal plane for a total of ~200 \ndata points. The scalp point data were interpolated as a surface using the thin \nplate spline technique. The scalp surface was aligned with the 3D scan of the \nhead and face based on the four digitized landmark points (right and left Tragion, \nPronasale, and Sellion) and combined to obtain a full head surface. Li et al. \n(2022)  developed a scalp probing rig which can be used to capture the actual 3D \nsurface of the scalp in spite of users having hair (accuracy M = \u22120.2749, SD = \n1.0153 mm). At the time of their presentation, they had collected 3D head data \nfor 68 participants.\nThe short history of head wearables also means the availability of data for rep -\nresenting TPs is a bigger issue than for fashion apparel. Even though 3D head \nscanners have been available and in use since the mid-1980s ( Robinette, 1986 ), \nmost sample data readily available on the head and face are (1) traditional 1D mea -\nsurements, (2) adults, (3) from military populations, and (4) contain only a hand -\nful of measurements on the head and face.

The whole-body 3D scan resolution (density of the points) was 2\u20135 mm and, although this is good enough for body-worn items, this resolution provides poor detail around the eyes and ears. For head-worn equipment, this type of resolution is typically not sufficient to provide the surface detail and accuracy required. Most headwear products require sub mm scanner resolution and <2 mm \nprecision on landmark placement and linear head and face measurement.\nIf there is a need to use 3D scanners for measuring, there are new scanning tech -\nnologies available focused on scanning the head region only, which can meet this level of resolution and precision. Some of the newer systems, such as the one by 3dMD\u2122, are fast enough to capture facial expressions and motion. This is referred to as a 4D system. This kind of technology can be very helpful for fit analysis, par -\nticularly if the scanner is used to capture people wearing the system while talking or moving. It can help identify when gaps occur or when a wearable is limiting motion(s) or slipping.\nMost professional traditional anthropometry (manual) measurement tools such as \ntape measures and calipers can measure at a 1 mm resolution. Measurements taken using traditional anthropometry tools have the added benefit of being comparable to many other traditional head anthropometry databases. This allows the use of other TP data to help find cases and to compare fit data for assessing sizing needs. It is important to note that significant differences have been observed when comparing measurements taken using traditional anthropometry measurement tools, with mea-surements extracted from 3D scanners ( Beaumont et al., 2017 ; Bredenkamp et al., \n2006 ; Kouchi & Mochimaru, 2011 ; Simmons & Istook, 2003 ).\nA few 3D scan databases exist that contain specific head scans with a typical reso -\nlution of a sub-millimeter.

Designed as a laboratory and field guide it has excellent illustrations \nand descriptions for bony landmarks. While originally published in 1971, new edi -\ntions continue to be published and it is used by colleges and universities throughout \nthe world. White had a more up-to-date osteology book indicating bony landmarks on the head and face ( White et al., 2012 ). Although it is recommended to keep to \nestablished and widely used head and face landmarks, deviations might be needed to best suit the fit of the specific head and face worn product. If new landmarks are created for a specific product use, these should be clearly defined and documented to ensure accuracy in repeated studies.\nFor head wearables, it is very important to be aware of differences due to gender \nand ethnicity when confirming representation of the TP, since the differences in these groups on head and facial characteristics are substantial. They will need to be considered when selecting cases and when doing testing. An example of gender dif -\nferences in two head measurements is seen in Figure 6.8 .\nThere are also substantial differences related to ethnicity. Using the same sample, \nwe plotted the head and face measurements for three different ethnic groups by gen -\nder in Figure 6.9 . In Figure 6.9 , we see that Asians tend to be larger for Head Breadth \nand smaller for Head Length than either White or Black populations. In other words, they have a different head shape. This may not be a factor for stretchy headwear like headbands but is likely to be an issue for more rigid headwear such as helmets or eyeglasses. It will be important to use Asian subjects to design and test headwear intended for an Asian TP. It is important to note that aspects such as eye depth, eye height in relation to the nose, and nose angle are affected by the orientation of the face versus the wearable.

Aspects \ndemonstrated in this case study includes:\n\u2022 Design loop test preparation\n\u2022 Design loop test flow and procedures\n\u2022 Product based head orientation and alignment\nThe purpose of the test was to assist in the design of head-mounted displays and \nother interfacing equipment such as hearing protection and oxygen masks. An exist -\ning helmet system was used as a prototype for establishing the location of eye, ear, \nnose, and mouth features with the helmet in place. This example is an excerpt and summary from Whitestone et al. (1998)  with some modifications to remove jargon, \nclarify the procedures, and hone in on the parts of that study that are relevant to head wearable testing and data collection.\nTest Preparation\nBefore the data collection, the test procedures were pilot-tested to validate them and \ndetermine the number of team members and data collection stations needed to pro -\ncess each subject in less than one hour. The subjects used for the first pilot test were the potential team members themselves. Four stations and five team members were determined to be necessary.\nAll team members were trained in all procedures, as were several people who \nwere to serve as backups in case someone became ill or needed to be away during data collection. Being trained in all procedures, enabled team members to change stations when necessary to avoid having to delay data collection, and to reduce fatigue. Test subjects were recruited to participate in the study. Some of these were employees of the organization and some were paid contract subjects. The training ensured all team members were measuring and assessing consistently and permitted the optimization of tasks at each test station. In this respect, the training also served as additional pilot testing. After team training, the tasks and number of members at each of the four data collection stations were established.\nTest Flow and Procedures\nThe first station was manned by one team member. Subjects were briefed on the rea -\nsons for collecting anthropometric data, as well as on the safe use of the measuring \nsystems. Subjects were then asked to read and sign a consent form and fill out a brief biographical form with their demographic information.\nThe second station was manned by one person. The anatomical landmarks were \nlocated by palpation or visual inspection and marked on the subjects with an eyeliner pencil. Some of these landmarks were used as measuring points for manual tool mea -\nsurements while others were used as reference points in the scans. Additional land -\nmarks, such as pupils, were later located by visual inspection of the scanned image.\nThe third station was manned by two people. Data were collected using man -\nual anthropometric tools. This station was staffed by a measurer and a recorder.

The recorder checked the data for obvious errors by comparing \nthe subject\u2019s percentile values with the percentiles from other large databases. The \nrecorder also assisted in measuring and positioning the subjects. After the traditional \nanthropometry data were collected, stickers were placed on the subject\u2019s face over \nthe marked landmarks to make them more visible and consistent in size in the 3D \nscans. To ensure all of the landmarks had a sticker in place, the roll of stickers was \npre-divided into strips with the exact number of stickers needed. This helped speed \nup the process.\nThe fourth station was the scanning station, which was manned by one person. \nAt this station each subject was properly positioned for the scan. A skull cap \nwhich reflects light and compresses the hair was placed on the subjects\u2019 heads. \nThis step results in clearer images in the scan and a better representation of the \nhead surface.\nAfter the regular head scan was made, two additional scans were made of each \nsubject:\n1. One with the chin raised to get the surfaces under the chin and on the top of \nthe head that might not be visible in the first scan\n2. One with the subject wearing his or her personal helmet and oxygen mask\nData were collected on 365 subjects from the target population of Air Force flight \ncrew members. There were four data collection sites, and the same procedures were \nused at all four locations. Since these were active-duty flight crew members, they \neach had their own helmets and oxygen masks that had been previously issued to \nthem with the aid of a skilled flight equipment technician. These were the items \nscanned. It was assumed that these items fit them.\nThe 3D scanner used was the Cyberware 4020-PS 3D Digitizer, which was one of \nthe first automated 3D scanners used for anthropometric data collection. It collected \nover 131,000 three-dimensional data points in approximately seventeen seconds. \nThe resolution of the scanned points varied depending on the radius of the object \nbeing scanned but was approximately 1.5 mm vertically and 1 mm horizontally over \nthe entire head and face.\nThis version of the scanner did not have a color camera to make flat-colored \nlandmark stickers visible in the scans. This feature was added in later versions of \nthe scanner ( Hoffmeister et al., 1996 ). For this study\u2019s landmarks green felt stickers \nwere used. These stickers absorbed light, making uniform round holes in the scans \nover the landmarks. These holes had to be filled so that the landmark location could \nbe identified and recorded.\nAfter data collection, the scans were individually processed and edited. To iden -\ntify landmark locations, create a polygonal mesh, and a solid watertight surface \nmodel a special software tool called Integrate was used ( Burnsides et al., 1996 ). All \n3D scans were run through an editing procedure where scans were displayed and \nlandmark locations, indicated by the uniform circular holes from the markers were \nvisibly inspected, and any landmarks found to be incorrectly identified or placed \nwere corrected.

Feature envelopes are the point distributions for named landmarks with respect to the axis system of the wearable. In this example, they indicated where the eyes and ears fall when wearing this helmet and oxygen mask. The process used can be applied to any wearable that has relatively rigid materials such as a helmet. It was as follows:\n1. Scan a representative helmet (i.e., same helmet model, same size that the subject wore) by itself\n2. Select helmet landmark coordinates from the helmet scan using visualiza -\ntion software\n3. Create a helmet-based coordinate system for alignment, using the helmet scan\n4. Register the representative helmet scan with each subject\u2019s encumbered scan by the best alignment of the helmet surfaces\n5. Register the two registered helmet scans (with and without the subject) to the subject\u2019s unencumbered scan by best alignment of visible head and face surfaces\n6.

Repeat for all subjects & generate bivariate plots and summary statistics for each landmark in the helmet-based coordinate system\nDimples on either side of the helmet were used to define the x-axis, with the posi -\ntive direction pointing to the left of the helmet. The z-axis runs through the midpoint of the front edgeroll and is orthogonal to x. The y-axis is orthogonal to the x- and z-axis. This is illustrated in Figure 6.10 .\nAfter registering the three scans together and transforming the landmarks for \neach subject into the helmet-based axis system bivariate plots (two axes at a time) of each landmark were viewed in the helmet-based system. The plots for the right and left pupils are shown in Figure 6.11 .\nIn summary, these helmets were situated on each subject\u2019s head in the way they \nwere worn in flight. Therefore, this spread of pupil locations is a reasonable way to begin designing a helmet-mounted display for this helmet and this TP. It indicated the type of variation that can be expected in each direction.

horizontal, vertical and depth \nranges for the position of the pupil in relation to the optics components were theo -\nretically determined. Visual registration included visual performance, eye tracking \nperformance, and visual comfort. The visual performance included the percentage of the virtual display area that was visible to the user. The eye-tracking performance included the ability of the eye-tracking cameras to capture the full pupil, iris/cornea and a minimum number of glints on the iris/cornea. The visual comfort included the position of the virtual content in relation to the eye. Since the prototype had no functional optics or eye-tracking components, the actual acceptable visual registra -\ntion of the device could not be evaluated. For this reason, the prototype test device included a 3D printed add-on (see Figure 6.14 ), which enabled a guide and measure \nof acceptance to the placement of the optics section of the device in relation to each test participant\u2019s pupils. This included a depth (z-distance) measure and acceptance range between the inner optics surface and the user\u2019s eyelid and a height (y-distance) measure and acceptance range of the pupil in relation to the optics components. These were both included as part of the COF metrics.\nFigure 6.15  illustrates the use of the 3D insert for evaluation of vertical (height) \nplacement of the device in relation to the pupil. The vertical slots are used to line up the vertical height of the wearable with the user\u2019s eyes by using a taller or shorter nosepiece. During the evaluation, if the middle of the pupil could be seen in the pro -\nvided slots, the height of the device was deemed acceptable. Since parallax would play such a vital part in the correct judgment of the vertical position of the device, a camera was used for the judgment. The camera was set up on a tripod and the cam -\nera lens was aligned horizontal to the participant\u2019s pupil height. The \u201cNeutral Gaze\u201d protocol (see the \u201cHead orientation and alignment Paragraph in Chapter 6) was used \nfor Head orientation and to position the participant. The participant\u2019s vertical eye height was measured, and the camera tripod height was adjusted to match the floor to center of lens height to the participant\u2019s vertical eye height. Figure 6.15a demon-strates when the wearable fitted too high on the face and was adjusted lower on the face by using a shorter nosepiece. Figure 6.15b illustrates a wearable height that was correctly placed in relation to the participant\u2019s eyes.

If the depth distance was at the bold line \u00b13 lines (mm), the depth was deemed acceptable. \nThe intended pupil-to-device optics depth was modified by 3 mm to accommodate the addition of the approximate eyelid thickness to the theoretical optimum pupil-to-optics distance. If the depth was too close, the forehead pad was exchanged for a thicker forehead pad. If the depth was too far, the depth was decreased by exchanging to a thinner forehead pad.

The vertical distance was measured using a Caliper between the Tragion landmark and the bottom edge of the wearable temple arms (see Figure 6.18 ). In addition to the Tragion to Temple arm vertical distance, \nside photos were taken before and after all slippage activities to visually assess if the temple arms slid down relative to the ear on the participant\u2019s head. If the vertical Tragion to Temple arm distance was reduced by more than 5\u00a0mm and the slippage was visible on the side photos, Temple arm slippage was indicated as positive.\nFinally, a question was asked to the participant about whether slippage of the back \ntemple arms was experienced during any of the activities to gauge the participant\u2019s subjective identification of slippage. Similarly, the proctor was asked to give his/her subjective input on whether he/she observed slippage during any of the activities. Finally, a minimum of two out of the four metrics had to be a positive indication of slippage before slippage was recorded for an individual.\nSampling Method\nDue to cost limitations, a relatively small sample size had to be used for this early \ndesign prototype test.

In addi -\ntion to the fit aspects included in the COF, user comfort following a wear period can also be evaluated with early prototype testing.\nFor physical fit, the evaluators looked at (1) does the device fit around the head, \nand (2) is good contact obtained in the areas that the device is designed to contact against the face including (a) forehead pad, (b) nose piece, and (c) temple pads. The fit testing indicated that the device could be comfortably donned by all test par -\nticipants, demonstrating that adequate temple band adjustment was afforded in the design. One caveat in the findings was that the test participants did not represent the largest head in the TP and future device fit evaluations will have to target persons representative of large (long and wide) heads.\nFor device fit in design contact areas, the testing indicated that the forehead pad \nand temple pad for all participants had acceptable contact at all the pad surfaces. For the nose piece contact, however, the evaluation highlighted that the nose piece was too narrow and didn\u2019t conform well to the nose shape variances to be accom -\nmodated. Figure 6.22  illustrates some examples of where poor nose piece accom -\nmodation was identified.\nAlthough undesired cheek contact was not one of the original COF metrics for \nphysical fit, it was identified as an issue during fit testing. When doffing the device after a wearing period of 30 minutes, an indent at the cheek area was identified for some participants. This is illustrated in Figure 6.23 .

This is a follow-\non from Case Study 2 using a more mature prototype in the fit testing. Aspects dem -\nonstrated in this case study include:\n\u2022 Updated prototype COF metrics, including methods for testing fit with a \nfunctional prototype\nModifications to the prototype included modifications to the housing and nose \npiece fit components to improve fit based on earlier fit evaluation findings. This pro -\ntotype included most of the internal electronics, including a functional eye-piece \nstack and eye tracking. At this point in the product development cycle, the display \nand eye-tracking software algorithms were still under development. This meant that \nthe combined binocular virtual image could not be projected, and the eye-tracking \nalgorithm determining eye-tracking success wasn\u2019t running yet. To represent the \nlack of these features for virtual display, an image was projected monocularly (to \none eye at a time), and by calculating the visible area for each display individually, \nthe visibility of the virtual display area by both eyes was calculated. For evalua -\ntion of the eye tracking performance, the eye tracking cameras were streamed and \neye images recorded. Eye images were post-processed and evaluated for acceptance \ncriteria. Another aspect added to the fit metrics included undesired device contact. \nWith the addition of internal electronics, it was determined through simulation and \ntesting that the surface temperatures at the projector bumps could exceed the safety \nlimit for 8-hour skin contact. As a result, the physical fit metrics had to be updated \nto include undesired contact between the projectors and the skin. The weight and \nCOM were representative of updated projections for the final headset. The device did \nnot include a computer and battery pack yet but was powered from a loose-standing \nprinted circuit board. In addition to the three categories included in the Case Study  \n2 COF list, an additional category for Comfort was added. Due to improvements \nto the design, it was mature enough to start evaluating aspects of comfort to enable \ndesign modifications focused on wear comfort. The updated COF included the fol -\nlowing four categories:\n1. Physical fit\n2. Visual registration\n3. Slippage and stability\n4. Comfort\nPhysical fit metrics predominantly remained the same, with the addition of two \nmetrics for nosepiece fit and one for undesired contact.

Fit metrics were added to the Physical fit COF to prohibit these poor fit results.\nThe visual registration  metrics changed entirely with the increased maturity \nof the device. The visual registration included two COFs: (1) virtual field of view (VFOV) and (2) eye tracking (ET) performance. For the assessment of VFOV, an image was projected monocularly to each, first the left and then the right displays respectively (see Figure 6.28 ). Eight lines are projected from the center of the image \nradially with line number 1 on the medial side. For the right display, line 1 was in the middle left and the numbers increased clockwise to number 8. For the left eye, line 1 was in the middle right of the display and the line numbers increased counter-clockwise to number 8. Participants were asked to read the outermost number for which they could see the full number and circle (no part of the circle may be cut off). Each circle represented 2 degrees in VFOV. The visual registration data collection Graphics User Interface (GUI) included a calculation of the percentage of the display visible monocularly, as well as ambinocularly (visible with any one or both eyes).  \nIf the ambinocular VFOV exceeded 85%, the fit was deemed acceptable.\nFor the assessment of ET, the two ET camera images per eye were streamed to the \nvisual registration GUI.

This means when in the correct fitting position, it must not loosen over time while being worn. At the same time, the force must not be so tight that it causes pressure discomfort to the user.\nBackground\nDuring a prototype fit test, the prototype design included a temple band closing \ntorque setting of 50 N\u00a0 mm. During this test, the percentage of participants that experienced the temple band slipping on their head, (13%), was slightly higher than intended for the design. One of the design changes suggested for implementation was an increased temple band closing torque. However, the design team was not confident which torque setting would provide the intended temple band stability, while not causing pressure discomfort around the head. In addition, the design and engineer -\ning teams were not satisfied with the way in which the temple band closed to its default closed position. Some of the prototype devices were not closing to the default temple arm setting. A larger temple band closing torque was suggested as a poten -\ntial solution for this issue as well. As a result, a follow up fit test was recommended where two larger temple band closing torque settings, 65 N\u00a0mm and 80 N\u00a0mm, would be tested. The goal of the test was twofold: (1) to determine if a temple arm closing torque increase would improve stability or an improvement in the return of the arms to the default closed position and (2) to determine if the temple band closing torque increase would result in increased discomfort.\nStudy Design and Sampling Method\nFor the follow-up testing, the order of the 65 N\u00a0mm and 80 N mm conditions were \nrandomized in a repeated measures study, with each participant testing both condi -\ntions. Since we wanted to know if these torques (65 and 80) improved the situation we found in the first test, we also compared the follow-up test results to the original 50 N mm test. A different sample of participants was used in the first fit test with  \n50 N mm than the second repeated measures test with the 65 N mm and 80 N mm, so repeated measures analysis was not possible for this comparison. The same proto -\ncol was used during all tests. For the first temple force condition, 50 N mm, N\u00a0=\u00a054 randomly selected participants were used. For the follow-up test, N\u00a0=\u00a040 randomly selected participants were randomly fitted with both devices\nTo determine which temple band closing torques would be best, two opposing \nfit criteria were identified for evaluation: (1) the slippage and stability, and (2) the 30-minute wear comfort of the device. The device was set up to its optimal fit for each participant by the investigator and the device operating temperature was main -\ntained throughout the study.\nAn overview of the study flow is provided in Figure 6.32 . To ensure that the \ndevice temperature was stabilized at operating temperature, the device was switched on at least 30 minutes before the study started. Before the participant entered the room, the proctor measured the device surface temperatures at predetermined loca -\ntions using an Infrared thermometer (FLIR\n\u00ae). The measured values were compared \nto the expected device operating surface temperatures and recorded in the question -\nnaire.

All participants put the device on themselves since a proctor cannot guide slight micro-adjustments that might be needed to ensure that the device feels balanced on the face and head and that the optimal positioning on the nose, forehead, sides and back of the head for a comfortable distribution of the load and pressure. After the headset was donned, the proctor went through a process to decide which fit components, nose piece and forehead pad, provided the most optimum fit per participant. This pro -\ncess is described in more detail in the paragraph \u201cDetermining best fit adjustment\u201d below. A physical fit assessment was performed followed by a 3D surface capture of the participant wearing the headset. The stability and slippage of the device were assessed after completing the head scan. The detail of activities and metrics included in the stability and slippage is described in more detail in the paragraph \u201cAssess sta -\nbility\u201d. Following the slippage and stability assessment, the participant was asked to sit comfortably on a chair while reading a magazine for the remainder of the time up to 30 minutes. After the 30-minute wear time, the proctor asked a series of comfort questions. These are described in more detail in the paragraph \u201cComfort assessment questions\u201d. On completion of the comfort assessment, the participant removed the device for the end of their study participation. After the participant was escorted out from the study room, the proctor repeated the measurement of the surface tempera -\ntures to verify that the device was still at the intended operating temperature range, and the temperature values were recorded in the questionnaire. If the temperature values fell outside of the intended operating thermal range, the participant\u2019s comfort results were excluded from the analysis.\nDetermining Best Fit Adjustment\nThe headset design had a selection of 5 nose pieces and 2 forehead pads, to provide \nthe optimal fit allowing for the best visual registration for the participant. The nose -\npieces were overall the same shape, with the primary difference being the length of the stem, starting from #1 being the shortest to #5 being the longest. Nosepiece #5 also had a slight inward curve. The forehead pad had two thicknesses, with #1 \nFIGURE 6.32  Study flow during the temple band closing torque trade study.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2803, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "edfc7012-24fb-4a1f-b1a9-1cb48446c263": {"__data__": {"id_": "edfc7012-24fb-4a1f-b1a9-1cb48446c263", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "312", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "25ef8272-2242-4db2-bded-051562aa4f80", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "312", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "f89794ecdeebde4fc3f49589537a00deedfe21b3bc64a439ea47ad40321c33a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "312 Product Fit and Sizing\nbeing the thinnest and #2 being the thickest.

The z score test for two population proportions was used instead of the t-test, since the slippage results are categorical data (\u201cY\u201d and \u201cN\u201d). In order to investigate the difference between comfort results for the different conditions, a comparison of means was used since ordinal data (10-point Likert scale results) were compared. Data collected during two different studies were included in this trade study; therefore, two different types of tests were used to investigate how the comfort results compare between the data samples. First of all, an independent t-test was used to compare the data collected during the first prototype test, 50 N mm, to the data collected during the second tests, 65 N mm or 80 N mm. An independent sample t-tests was used here since data was collected on two different groups of people during the first and second studies. Secondly, a paired-sample t-test was used to compare the datasets collected for the 65 N mm to 80 N mm force conditions. The paired-sample t-test could be used here since the same people repeated both the 65 N mm and 80 N mm force condition tests. t-Tests were used instead of the non-parametric alternatives, the Mann-Whitney U-Test or Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, due to the relatively large sample size (N > 20) and the t-test having greater statistical power. The datasets \ncollected during the two different studies could be compared to each other only due to the same protocol being used during both studies. If all the studies were run with the same participants, a repeated-measures ANOVA could have been run to compare all three to each other. All statistical tests were performed using SPSS analysis software and an on-line calculator for the z score test for two population proportions ( https://www.socscistatistics.com/tests/ztest ).\nResults\nThe slippage findings are illustrated in Figure 6.36 . No or slight slippage was deemed \nacceptable, but a positive Slippage result as per the fit guide was deemed unaccept -\nable. Between the 50 N mm (9% Slippage), 65 N mm (7.5% Slippage) and 80 N mm \n(5% Slippage) conditions, a slight reduction was observed in slippage as the temple band force increased. Therefore, a higher force would be preferred to reduce the prevalence of slippage.\nThe differences in slippage (with \u201cY\u201d = \u201cSlippage\u201d and \u201cN\u201d = \u201cNo slippage\u201d or \n\u201cSlight slippage\u201d) were investigated between the condition with the most slippage  \n(50 N\u00a0mm) and least slippage (80 N\u00a0mm) to determine if the differences observed were deemed significance. A z = 0.7777 (with two-tailed p = 0.4354) was calculated for slip -\npage between 50 N mm and 80 N mm. Since p > 0.05, this difference observed in \nslippage was not deemed statistically significant. Since the best and worst slippage results indicated no statistically significant difference, the slippage for 65 N mm will similarly indicate no statistically significant difference.\nTo conclude, the slippage results between the conditions were not statistically \nsignificant.

Looking at the differences in comfort \nbetween the 50 N mm and 80 N mm conditions, no statistically significant differ -\nences were observed for any of the comfort metrics. The box-and-whisker plots in Figures 6.37 \u20136.40 illustrate the comparative distribution of the comfort results \nfor the different conditions tested.\nThe box-and-whisker plots provide some further insights into the marginal \ndifferences in comfort between the conditions. For overall  comfort and nose  \ncomfort, although no significant differences were observed and no noteworthy differences in median values, the higher temple band closing torque condition (80 N mm) had fewer persons with lower ( <6) comfort scores compared to the \nlower force conditions. The nose comfort could be explained by a higher temple force resulting in better weight distribution around the temples, and therefore less weight on the nose.\nFor the rest of the comfort scores, a consistent pattern was not prevalent from  \n50 N mm to 65 N mm to 80 N mm.\nTo conclude on the comfort findings, no practically significant differences were \nobserved between overall, nose, forehead, and side of head comfort between the difference torsion band conditions. The overall slippage and comfort findings showed no significant difference between the different torsion band forces. Since the largest torsion spring force, 80 N mm, ensured the best result of returning the torsion band to its default closing position it was therefore selected as the final tor -\nsion band force setting.\nIn summary, this case study demonstrated a typical approach used in a design \nloop trade study to inform design decisions and direction.

The frequency plot of slippage is indicated in Figure 6.41  \nand shows that the combined incidence of yes or little slippage was 27.3%.\nTo investigate the potential causes of slippage, a stepwise discriminant analysis \nwas run including all the anthropometric variables available for the participants, relevant to the headset fit.

As a result, the discriminant analysis was run on different combina-tions of categories. Firstly, it was run with Yes, Maybe and No as dependent variables. Secondly, Maybe and Yes were combined into a \u201cSlippage\u201d and No into a non-slippage group and these two groups were selected as dependent variables. Thirdly, \u201cMaybe\u201d was combined with the \u201cNo\u201d group as the non-slippage group versus \u201cYes\u201d as the slip -\npage group. And finally, the slippage group comprises all \u201cYes\u201d and the non-slippage group comprises all \u201cNo\u201d. The first discriminant analysis (\u201cYes\u201d, \u201cMaybe\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d dependent variables) indicated Head length as the discriminator (see Table 6.7 ).\nThe second discriminant analysis (Slippage (\u201cYes\u201d and \u201cMaybe\u201d) versus non-\nslippage (\u201cN\u201d) as dependent variables) indicated Head length and Bi-Tragion width as discriminators (see Table 6.8 ). This discriminant function is a contrast, where \nbreadth is contrasted with length. This means that slippage versus no slippage is observed in cases with either short wide heads versus long narrow heads. From expe -\nrience with head Anthropometry, we know that these head shapes are indicators of Asian versus non-Asian participants.\nThe third and fourth discriminant analyses (Slippage (\u201cYes\u201d) versus non-slippage \n(\u201cN\u201d and \u201cMaybe\u201d) and \u201cYes\u201d versus \u201cNo\u201d as dependent variables respectively) indi -\ncated hair type, nose width (max) and face length were significant discriminators \nTABLE 6.7\nDiscriminant Analysis Results with \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cMaybe\u201d, \u201cNo\u201d as Dependent Variables\nWilks\u2019 LambdaStandardized Canonical \nDiscriminant Function Coefficients\nTest of Function(s)Wilks\u2019 \nLambda Chi-square df Sig.\u00a0\nFunction 1\n1 0.904 7.480 2 0.024 Head Length cm 1.000", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2317, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e140245-0b85-4be4-ae7e-3921303a072f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e140245-0b85-4be4-ae7e-3921303a072f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "325", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5de0a354-b934-49b8-88a5-6735a8ac95b2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "325", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "686ac4122e7d96235182ba3f81e779dfd94d4b83a05fd99d0f1139d92ce2cf76", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "325 Head and Face Wearables\n(see Table 6.9  for \u201cYes\u201d versus \u201cNo\u201d  and \u201cMaybe\u201d). This is also a contrast with Nose \nWidth contrasted against the other two. In other words, as Nose Width gets larger the \nother two get smaller and vice versa.\nBased on the findings of the discriminant function (also observed during pre -\nvious studies on similar products) slippage could be identified for predominantly Asian participants. The distribution of the discriminant function variables was investigated by looking at bivariate and distribution plots . Asian participants \nwere furthermore included in the plots to observe further trends. Head length and Bi-Tragion breadth, with Asian versus non-Asian point label, are illustrated in Figure 6.42 . This plot illustrates that, for both males and females, a relatively large \npercentage of slippage (\u201cYes\u201d and \u201cMaybe\u201d) cases were observed for persons with wide, short heads. A large number of these were Asian. In addition, apart from two participants, all other slippage cases (including \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cMaybe\u201d) had head lengths shorter than 19.5 mm.\nThe distribution of face length versus nose width, with hair type as point label, is \nshown in Figure 6.43 . Slippage was observed for persons with a face length shorter \n12.5 cm and nose widths wider than 3.2 cm. The majority of persons who had slip -\npage had straight hair (hair type = 1).\nThe distribution of slippage is illustrated for hair type in Figure 6.44 . This figure \nindicates a clear higher incidence of slippage for people with straight hair.

During the data analysis, the fit scan was aligned to the base anthropom -\netry scan using the closest point alignment of a selection of 10\u201320 points on the face. Thereafter, the headset CAD file was aligned to the fit scan using the same method. Finally, the fit scan was removed leaving the headset CAD aligned to the base anthropometry scan ( Figure 6.25  demonstrates the process). With this alignment, \nseveral different scan analyses were performed. All scan analysis was performed using Polyworks Inspector\nTM.\nFirst of all, a cross-section  was taken through the midway of the headset (see \nFigure 6.45 ). This cross-section provided insight into how each individual\u2019s head \ncurve shape compared to the headset design fit.\nThe cross-sections were compared for persons who experienced slippage versus \npersons who did not experience slippage. Looking at the cross-sections for persons who experienced slippage (see Figure 6.46 ), the first characteristic that was visually \nobserved was that the heads were noticeably wider in relation to length compared to the non-slippage persons (see Figure 6.47 ). On further investigation, it was observed \nthat the flexible temple band did not closely follow the curve of the head, especially in the area where the flexible band departed from the rigid temple arms.

It was one of a series of studies by the Air Force Research \nLaboratory (AFRL) and Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) with the goal to provide military aviation crews with effective, affordable, reliable, easy-to-use hear -\ning protection that allowed safe, extended exposures in up to 150 dB of aviation related noise. This case study is a summary.\nIn this study the effectiveness of a passive hearing protection earmuff and cloth \nhelmet assembly was measured using a sound attenuation measurement system called the Microphone-in-real-ear (MIRE) system. The earmuff had earcups to reduce the amount of sound coming into the ear and it was worn with a cloth helmet, referred to as a cranial, that enabled impact protective panels, called shields, to be attached. An illustration of the entire ensemble is shown in Figure 6.50 .\nThe earmuff came in only one adjustable size. The cloth cranial helps to hold the \nearcups in place, and it came in four sizes: 6.75, 7, 7.25, and 7.5. The goal of this fit test was to determine the range of accommodation within one cloth cranial size. Knowing the range of fit in one size would allow the range to be mapped against the full TP sample to determine what cranial sizes were needed and if any could be dropped.\nPoor Sizing Quality\nIt was assumed that since this product was in use it was accommodating the TP. This was \nintended to be a sizing loop study to determine purchasing numbers per size. However, the test revealed the design modifications were necessary to accommodate the TP.\nPrior to testing the soft cranials and their patterns were measured. This led to the \nunexpected discovery that three of the four sizes (6.75, 7, and 7.25), had little or no actual difference between them.

These conditions interact so simultaneous fit for all \ncriteria was important. For example, the most comfortable cranial may be the loos -\nest, but the best sound attenuation is achieved with a tight fit. A questionnaire was \nused to assess comfort and slippage, with the subjects asked to perform a set of \nmovement tasks.\nStudy Method\nPrior trade studies had indicated that the size 7.5 provided worse sound attenuation \nthan the other sizes. It was assumed that this was due to a looser fit over the ears. \nTherefore, the size selected for testing was size 6.75. Any of the three smallest sizes \nwould be essentially equivalent so the smallest of the three should provide as good \nor better performance than the other two.\nThe test sample consisted of 30 men and 30 women, each tested in the size 6.75. \nThe fit test process was as follows:\n\u2022 Each subject was measured manually for a series of 1D head measurements \nand a 3D scan of their head was done.\n\u2022 Assembly was donned, and the earmuff and chin strap were adjusted to \nachieve the best comfort and stability possible.\n\u2022 Performed a series of movements and tasks and filled out the comfort and \nstability questionnaire.\n\u2022 Moved to a special MIRE facility where the sound attenuation was evaluated.\nConclusions and Recommendations\nMIRE attenuation testing results indicate that males consistently achieve a higher atten -\nuation score than females by 5\u201310 dB and the addition of the cranial did not add sig -\nnificant hearing protection for them. The different response for females was determined \nto be due to the earmuff adjustability and band length. The band was not adjustable for \nmost females, who needed a smaller band but were unable to adjust it to the needed \nlength. The men, on the other hand, were able to adjust the band for their head size.\nWhile lower MIRE attenuation scores and minimal adjustment were the most \ncommon among women, those men with Bitragion-coronal arcs less than 340 mm \nalso had the issue. It was determined that allowing the band to reduce in size by  \n20 mm would provide enough adjustment to accommodate all the females and the \nfew males who required a smaller band length than the current configuration allows.\nThe band length caused all critical fit failures. It was concluded that with the \nadded adjustment the male and female TP could be accommodated in one size with -\nout slippage, without significant discomfort, and with maximal sound attenuation.\nHowever, there was another important fit issue identified that was not part of the \nCOF for the fit mapping. The proper placement of the front impact shield. For many \nof the subjects, the proper earcup positioning and the proper impact shield location \non the forehead were not both possible simultaneously. This meant that the front \nimpact shield was not in the right position, (over the forehead) to provide impact pro -\ntection when the ear cups were in the right place for hearing protection.

However, rotation of the \nhead band by this amount would force the earcups off the ears wrecking the sound \nattenuation. The proximity of the sleeve snap to the front impact shield only allows for \n1 mm forward rotation before the head band contacts the impact shield. Therefore, it \nwas concluded that the front impact shield would need to be adjusted forward 32 mm to \naccommodate forehead protection while maintaining hearing protection, or additional \nsizes would be needed that had a lower position for the front impact shield.\nIn summary, the fit test intended to be a sizing loop fit test, but instead highlighted \ndesign and sizing failures in the product. In order to fix the problem, the team rec -\nommended that shortening the headband, to a headband that allows for a 20 mm \nsmaller length would accommodate the TP in one size provided the front impact \nshield location is not required to be in the correct place for all users. If the placement \nof the front impact shield was important, re-design would be needed to either allow \nshield rotation or have additional sizes allowing its proper placement. If a fit test was \nnot performed in order to provide accurate size prediction numbers, the sizing chart \nmight have been used resulting in purchasing a range of sizes that did not adequately \nfit and protect any of the intended users.\nREFERENCES\nAbeysekera, J., Holm\u00e9r, I., & Dupuis, C.

It also details the complex anatomy and biomechanics of the foot and the resulting complexity of designing effective footwear products. This includes shoe anatomy from a point of view of the fit and functional aspects, and the methodologies to improve the fit of the foot -\nwear by following the design loop and the sizing loop. The issues with establishing an effective concept-of-fit (COF) for footwear and related assessment methods to study the physical interaction between the foot and shoe are also discussed. Finally, examples of how to improve the footwear design and sizing are provided in the form of two case studies.\nBACKGROUND\nFoot anatomy is one of the most complex in the body. The foot supports the body weight, transferring the forces to the ground, and it is responsible for the body move -\nment with efficiency and stability. The anatomical structure of the foot is deformable to enable the proper absorption and distribution of forces through the foot. Thus, foot shape and dimensions are dynamic since they change during body movements such as walking, standing, or running.\nThe feet are also affected by the footwear. For example, the height of the heel \nmodifies the shape and posture of the foot even for low values. The upper material of the shoe compresses the foot modifying the shape and dimensions while contain -\ning soft tissue and restraining the movement of the foot in the shoe. This influence depends on the stiffness level of the upper material and the design of its structure (e.g., pump, sneaker). Therefore, the anthropometry of the foot measured barefoot and in a static posture varies substantially from the foot in real conditions, inside the shoe and during movement. Consequently, the anthropometry of the foot and its variability do not transfer directly to the measurements of the footwear. The creation of footwear that accommodates the anthropometry and biomechanics of the foot requires the development of a form, called a last.\nMost current footwear development processes are based on old rules and guide -\nlines that have not been verified and updated according to the specific needs and requirements of the target population (TP). They lack tests and validations with actual people early in the development process. As a result, many footwear products go unsold, must be sold with high discounts, or remain unused because they are uncomfortable or do not function as desired.

One of the issues is inconsistent sizing such that \ncustomers need a size up or down from their usual size, or the shaping of the size does not work for their foot. This is particularly important in the context of online shopping, and centralized purchasing of footwear (e.g., uniforms, and safety foot -\nwear provided by the company). These issues can result when the last and the base size are not validated against the TP.\nFootwear is made from components that must be assembled and fit together. \nThese components include the last, the upper material and its pattern, the sole, insole, shank, heel, and often special components such as rigid metal toe caps or sole puncture protection components. Some examples are shown in Figure 7.1 . The shoe \nlast is the \u201ccentral component\u201d that assures the proper integration between all the components. As a consequence, any shoe last modifications and the final approval of the last have implications for the design of all the components.\nAnother issue is functional design flaws that make it all the way to production. \nThe fit issues are identified too late in the process after the design is nearly complete. This occurs when the evaluation of the final version of the shoe is done as the last step in the process of development of the \u201cbase size\u201d instead of the base size being determined by early prototypes. At this point in the process, changes are expensive, time consuming, and fixing the issues may affect several components (e.g., sole, insole). This situation is particularly critical because suppliers of these components are often outsourced or located in other regions.\nFIGURE 7.1  Footwear components assembly.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1728, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d9f62351-3a03-4919-bec4-f58996a2de18": {"__data__": {"id_": "d9f62351-3a03-4919-bec4-f58996a2de18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "341", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "16c830c0-3619-41a3-9fbc-64d2747b02b6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "341", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "378830f0c4bc31b82048e78ed99881e5964ff2e3d6eda0e0a8fe7f646a54b987", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "341 Footwear\nOften the requirements of these components change during the development pro -\ncess when partial validations or reviews reveal that design modifications are needed. \nFor effective design and production, these changes must be properly communicated \nto all the stakeholders involved and adaptations made in a timely and accurate man -\nner. This means that, for footwear, changes made late in the development process \nare more costly than changes made early. Currently, the decision making is depen -\ndent upon the knowledge and experience of the designer or developer with limited \ndata. This is particularly frequent for fashion footwear. With the Sustainable Product \nEvaluation, Engineering, and Design (SPEED) process, this knowledge is developed \ninto a knowledge database that can be revisited to give the designers and developers \nmore consistent and reliable knowledge for better decision making. The application \nof the SPEED process to fashion footwear development is explained in more detail \nin Case Study 1 of this chapter.\nThe SPEED process provides evidence-based data to designers and developers to \nhelp them make more informed decisions. It uses trade studies and prototype test -\ning during design, ensuring that all the components work well together and fit, at a \nminimum, the base size users before the product is finalized. Any issues are resolved \nearly when changes are less expensive to make, and since the decisions are based on \nvalid data, the decisions are better informed requiring fewer product iterations. It \nensures the product accommodates the TP well, minimizing waste and optimizing \nsales potential. Although it adds some additional steps in the beginning compared \nto the current process, in the end, we arrive at a better product and often, by refining \nthe product early when it is fast and inexpensive to do so, we save time. The duration \nof the development process can be controlled by introducing a proper design of the \nvalidation test and an optimal integration in the internal development process of the \ncompany.\nThe benefits of the SPEED process are:\n\u2022 Optimal fit of the product catalog.  The comfort of the new collections \nwill be improved and can be considered as an identity element of the brand.\n\u2022 Consistency of the fit in relation to the sizes.  Better communication with \nconsumers and good consumer confidence in quality and sizing for both \nonline shopping and centralized purchasing.\n\u2022 Streamlined design and development process using a fit standard.  \nEstablishing precise criteria for the last dimensions significantly reduces \nthe need for redesign. Then, fit trials could become primarily a verification \nstep, minimizing the required adjustments.\n\u2022 Company core knowledge database.  Since the testing and data collection \nare done inside the company, it forms a knowledge database for future data-\nbased decision making. This improves quality, reduces risk, and reduces \ntime to market for future products.\nAs in the mass-produced apparel industry, the footwear industry has several good \npractices, which is why they can sell footwear and make a profit.

All the information collected in this phase is the base for developing the concept and lines of the new collection. This phase establishes the product requirements and is used throughout the industry today. We refer to this as the Inputs phase. The SPEED process adds the development of key performance indicators (KPIs), and the concept-of-fit (COF) to ensure all stakeholders agree before proceeding. Without these processes, the performance and fit criteria can be a moving target leading to continuous changes and needless iterations.\nSecond, the footwear industry uses cases in the form of shoe lasts development. \nThe last is used to produce the footwear, so rather than being the shape of the wear -\ner\u2019s foot, it is the shape of the inside of the shoe or boot. The shape that fits depends on the type of shoe and the complexity of proportioning and shape of the foot of the wearer versus the last.\nThere are companies that produce and sell lasts to footwear manufacturers, such as \nJones and Vining ( https://jonesandvining.com/lasts /) that make and sell lasts for all \nkinds of footwear, Sorrell Notions and Findings ( https://sorrellnotionsandfindings.  \ncom/product-category/boot-lasts /) that sell lasts specifically for cowboy boots, \nCrispinians ( https://www.crispinians.com /) that make custom wooden shoe lasts \nusing numerically controlled milling, and Podohub ( https://podohub.com/custom-\nshoe-lasts /) that make custom lasts using 3D printing.\nThe SPEED process selects or creates the base size last using data from the TP \nand the case selection methods described in Chapter 3 , then validate it with trade \nstudies (design loop) to verify and adjust before finalizing it. This ensures the foot -\nwear will fit the base size for the TP and will work effectively for the type of foot -\nwear and materials to be used. The last is critical to effective fit and fixing any issues early will be cheaper and faster than having to start over with a refined set of lasts. We provide an example of how to do this in the first case study later in this chapter.\nThe validation process of the last is like the block patterns used in clothing. To \nvalidate the fit of the last, a mock-up of the footwear is first manufactured using a similar upper design and materials but using a preliminary sole. A live model, who represents the reference anthropometric foot dimensions of the base size, performs a fit test of the shoe prototype. The feedback gathered is used to modify the dimen -\nsions of the last.\nModifying a shoe last is complex. It is an organic shape without geometrical \nreferences. The modification in one section must be smoothed to transition to the neighboring sections. Therefore, once the last has been refined and verified, on the fit model, it is important to do trade studies with 3\u20135 additional subjects to ensure it will work for more than one person. The first iterations do not have to use the final materials. They are a quick check to ensure there are no major problems.\nOften the design of the different components is done in parallel, so issues can \noccur later when the final materials, thickness of the insoles, and other designed features are implemented. Our SPEED process allows for interim checks during the process using trade studies and prototype tests to speed up development, catching", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3700, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "34e39878-fd2a-48cb-893c-9fb249bd41fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "34e39878-fd2a-48cb-893c-9fb249bd41fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "343", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e71d1870-46ae-433f-8e2e-212290ac2558", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "343", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "4d857836c154b372679b1d08b3b817b02448e95f37b292f79fae00e805a2307a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "343 Footwear\nsome mismatches early. However, it is also important to validate the fit with proto -\ntypes in the final materials and configurations. The prototype test of all the actual \ncomponents and the complete footwear product should include at least 5\u201310 subjects representing the full range of fit for the base size. This validates the size.\nSometimes the schedule requirements may put pressure on to reduce or eliminate \nthis fit validation loop. This will increase the risk of a suboptimal fit and footwear performance. Sometimes the results of the tests done in this phase, may suggest the need to refine the design and sometimes to refine the last. A quick test with a few subjects can be reassuring or convincing to management that a more thorough test is needed before proceeding with the other sizes. Once the company has a database of fit and anthropometry and a fit standard with a validated base size last for a TP there will be less need for some of the validation tests.\nFinally, the footwear industry has established standard shoe and boot length grad -\ning systems (Mondopoint, EU, and UK). Conversion charts are reported in stan -\ndards (ISO 19407:2023). While these grading systems may not be optimal for every wearable, they are well-established and understood by consumers so it is usually best to use them (provided you validate the base size), unless the footwear is some special type for which a different grade will be beneficial. However, these grades are foot-length grades only and do not address the width or product shaping grade. The footwear developer must determine those aspects, and this is best done with the aid of trade studies and prototype tests in the design and sizing loops to ensure the adequation to the TP. It will also indicate if there is a need for width sizes, in addition to the length sizes.\nThe SPEED process includes a fit audit in the sizing loop to ensure the graded \nproduct will accommodate the TP, verify that the size designations are correct, as well as provide data for the tariff which indicates how many of each size to produce and sell to minimize waste. For a commercial manufacturer it may not be cost effec -\ntive to produce sizes that will have few wearers. For organizations that must fit every -\none, such as the military or firefighters, it may be more cost effective to make use of an off-the-shelf product for most people and a custom product for the few people at the extremes. The fit audit will help make these decisions. The fit audit can also help wearers select their best fit size.

When comfort is not the priority, the design of the shoe can go against good ergonomic principles. The regular use of such dress footwear may cause many foot problems resulting in painful feet.

Both effects can only be effectively measured with fit testing on live \nsubjects and this kind of preference will influence not only the design but also the accommodation range of foot anthropometry and how many of each size will be needed for a given TP. When establishing the requirements for this type of shoe, the accommodation range and the relationship with the distributions of foot width for the base size must be included. If this information is known during the requirement definitions, a cost-benefit analysis can be included as a result of the fit test and the projections against TP to decide the efficiency of creating additional width sizes.\nThe sole for a pump is usually thin and is made of hard leather without any capac -\nity for pressure distribution.

Like the dress pumps it can have an issue with heel slip -\npage when walking due to the interaction of forces as shown in Figure 7.5.\nSince ballerinas are usually made of a softer material, slippage can be a problem \nunless the length is very precise and tight. A loose fit produces uncomfortable slip -\npage in the heel that is compensated pressing with claw-shaped toes. On the other hand, a tight-fit causes overpressure in the heel and the dorsum of the toes that often produce blisters. The upper material of ballerinas may need some stretch and the last may need to be shorter for a given size than the last of a pump. Comfort and slippage are competing issues that can only be effectively assessed by means of tests with users. This can best be done with a prototype fit test of the base size to establish the range of fit within the size and the suitable sizing of the base size last.\nFIGURE 7.4  (a) Barefoot toes front view.

Originally, Oxfords were for -\nmal, laced shoes for men, made of leather. The typical components of an Oxford \nshoe are shown in Figure 7.6 . They have evolved into a range of styles (e.g., derby, \nmonk, blucher) and there are also versions for women. Traditionally, they have a pointed toe shape, and they are made of rigid leather for the upper and sole. As a result, it provides a tight fit and a small range of accommodation. For this reason, this type of shoe is usually offered in extra width sizes.\nTypically, the Oxford has a thin sole made of leather that prevents flexion at the \nmetatarsal region. This is required to avoid the generation of anti-aesthetic creases and wrinkles in the forefoot. The lack of flexibility and extra length modifies the person\u2019s gait pattern making it more difficult to bend the shoe around the metatarsal arch of the forefoot.

This can necessitate extra room at the toe area to accommodate the lack of flexibility of metallic parts as illustrated in Figure 7.8  and minimize discomfort due \nto rubbing or pinching.\nThe toe cup introduces an extra volume and it is responsible for the bulky appear -\nance of this footwear. Safety boot upper material covers all the foot and is thicker compared to other types of footwear to ensure appropriate foot protection. The bot -\ntom is usually very thick including different layers which may limit the flexibility, adaptation to the movement and proprioception of the user. As a result, safety foot -\nwear is often very heavy, robust, and non-deformable. The requirements for these items might include an assessment of the wearer\u2019s ability to do his or her job or to accomplish the required tasks.\nSafety footwear used at the workplace will be worn all day and used while per -\nforming different, often repetitive tasks. It can be important to establish and test the type of postures and activities required by the user in the course of their work. For instance, the requirements will be different for a workplace that requires a stand -\ning posture most of the time and a work that requires a combination of different activities and posture (e.g., walking, driving, squats, load handling). In the first case it is better to specify requirements related to pressure distribution of the foot plant in standing posture to reduce foot pain, while in the second case, it will be more \nFIGURE 7.8  Effect of metal parts in shoe fit ( Ramiro et al., 1995 ).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2412, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c623a372-1152-43d0-85aa-0ff4d5e33a3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c623a372-1152-43d0-85aa-0ff4d5e33a3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "351", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3372788a-2c64-47d5-8d44-a80407cd522c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "351", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "9dc05e6b78f568e9347ba803eb532812694435543326693fb71754d1a61be464", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "351 Footwear\noptimal to improve the flexibility of the shoe to adapt to the movements and extreme \npostures and to reduce the overall weight of the shoe.\nMedical clogs are a type of occupational footwear that requires to be easy to put \non and take off, be resistant against contaminants, be comfortable for long duration standing and walking tasks, be designed to prevent slips, trips, and falls and be easy to clean and disinfect. They usually include an anatomical insole to reduce over-pressures and allow for comfortable standing for long periods of time.\nThe use of safety footwear is mandatory thus, it should accommodate almost all \nfoot types in off-the-shelf sizes with the option of custom fit sizes for extreme sizes or pathologies. Sizing loop fit testing is important for this purpose and can help in making decisions about which sizes to produce in quantity, how many of each size to produce or purchase, and which to custom-make.\nspoRts Foot WeaR\nThe development of athletic footwear is based on the specific needs and require -\nments for each type of sport (e.g., running, hiking, golf, basketball, soccer). The bio -\nmechanics of the movements of certain sports are relevant to optimize performance and to prevent injuries. With this aim, requirements related to the grip of the sole for specific sports surfaces and movement directions, the energy return, the stability, or the shock absorption are some of the priorities for the development of sports shoes. For the adequate performance of these functional aspects of the shoe, fit is also an important factor. For instance, a sole and a midsole designed to achieve good stabil -\nity will not be efficient if the fit of the shoe at the heel area is too loose.\nSome important aspects for establishing requirements include the sports surface, \nexpected sports movement, biomechanical loads, and shoe stability on the foot. The type of sport surface is critical for the design of the sole. The grip on the sports surface is important for providing protection against slips, trips and falls as well as allowing for the required dexterity for a specific sport performance. Some examples are golf shoes (natural grass), soccer (with different soles for natural and artificial grass), running shoes, basketball shoes, tennis (considering also different types of surfaces), and mountain or climbing shoes. The type and material of the sole neces -\nsarily impact the last and the overall fit.\nPerformance of sports movements is key to achieving good results in any sport, \nand the fit of the shoe can be an important factor. Each sport can include a single or a combination of different sports movements such as straight running, lateral displace -\nment, sprint, change of direction, vertical jump and landing, torso rotation, cycling, and golf swing, and each can require different properties in the shoe. Some examples are illustrated in Figure 7.9 . In some instances, the shoe can be required to help pre -\nvent certain movements such as ankle pronation, supination, or knee torque.\nThe level and type of biomechanical loads are relevant to define the requirements \nfor the protection of the body that can be introduced by different components of the shoe. The specifications and solutions to protect the athlete (e.g., energy absorption of impact loads) are sometimes negative to maximize performance. This is the rea -\nson why different shoes are often designed for training and for competition, focusing on protection or performance.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3501, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2159ca37-d507-47f8-a274-74e62b659954": {"__data__": {"id_": "2159ca37-d507-47f8-a274-74e62b659954", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "352", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5cde0d2c-c46f-46a7-93b1-9afddc0b0a30", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "352", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "e4db88aaf168dd908c1d1a47e03103ee9c5a142a38458776e8dd7d8807004a03", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "352 Product Fit and Sizing\nPrototype fit testing is usually important to maximize the behavior of differ -\nent components of the shoe (e.g., stability, movement adaptation, thermal comfort). \nAdditionally, there can be some specific sports elements that should be assessed. For instance, in the case of soccer boots, fit is important to have a good control of the ball ( Olaso Melis et al., 2016). In these situations, it can be very important that \nexperienced athletes in these sports are used as test subjects.\nRunning shoes typically include a bulky bottom with a thick midsole made of \ncushioning and very light material, and a thin sole to provide an optimal surface grip. New trends in running footwear also include a curved carbon plate and thick midsoles of reactive materials that provides a return of energy. Lightness is directly related to performance and the upper material usually needs to be light, breathable and can be adapted to different foot shapes. Sometimes the upper material can be too flexible allowing the foot to shift left and right over the sole, particularly when run-ning over uneven surfaces. Experienced runners will be able to provide immediate feedback about these sorts of issues.\nThe structure of soccer shoes is determined by the design of the sole. It is a thin \nplate with a distribution of studs at the forefoot and heel to increase the traction with the turf surface. Leather is the most frequently used material for the upper part of the shoe use to its long-lasting durability. For soccer footwear, the impact and ball control with the foot dorsum requires a high durability and a good perception of the ball touch therefore, the upper material is very fitted to the foot. Only experienced soccer players can give good feedback about these issues.\nSports footwear always requires good properties of breathability and sweat \nabsorption. Additionally, the environmental conditions should be considered. For wet outdoor activities (e.g., hiking, trail running, climbing), shoes include water -\nproof membranes as well as protection against cool temperatures in the case of win -\nter sports. Therefore, it can be important to set up and maintain the environmental conditions of the sport when doing prototype testing.\nKEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPI s)\nKPIs are the defined acceptance or rejection criteria for the product.

An acceptable fit for an individual is defined and docu -\nmented in the COF.\nKPIs must be documented and measurable. Initially, it is common for the require -\nments and the acceptance criteria to be set too high and sometimes are difficult or \neven impossible to meet. During the development process, as we learn what is pos -\nsible to achieve, the specifications are often revised and updated. KPIs allow us to \ntrack these changes. There are also some competing requirements, so it is necessary \nto prioritize them or establish the points of compromise. Well-documented KPIs \nhelp us accomplish this.\nThere are several types of KPIs related to footwear including:\n\u2022 Quality \u2013  these tests are usually performed in the footwear industry. They \nrelate to basic quality specifications and are highly related to the price of \nthe components. Manufacturers of footwear components use KPIs to con -\ntrol the quality of upper, insole and sole materials, laces, and footwear \nmanufacturers also use these tests to control the quality of their products.\n\u2022 Safety  \u2013 safety footwear should comply with a list of relevant standards \nsuch as resistance against an impact load in the toes, anti-perforation of the \nsole, antistatic or electric isolation.\n\u2022 Functionality \u2013  functional KPIs are not very common for most footwear \ntoday. Only companies interested in research and innovation include func -\ntional tests to ensure a high-level comfort for the wearer of the product. \nIn particular, sport footwear companies are the pioneers in controlling the \nfunctional KPI of the shoe. This type of KPI can be part of the COF.\n\u2022 Overall fit \u2013  fit KPIs usually indicate the proportion of the TP that must be \naccommodated in the footwear. This is documented in the COF along with \na definition of what constitutes a fit.\nKPIs can be measured in many ways. Physical tests can be applied to single com -\nponents or to the complete footwear. They might include the assessment of aspects \nsuch as strength of materials, compression test of insole, midsole and sole, stitching \nstrength, friction of the sole with the ground, wear, or ultraviolet resistance.\nFit and function KPIs usually require the use of human subjects, a complete foot -\nwear product as a complete pair. Only one foot might be needed in the first stages of the \ndevelopment when there is just a mock-up to validate the last fit and the upper design. \nHowever, footwear performance overall will require both. The KPI must specify what \nlevel of fit or function is a pass, and/or what percentage of the subjects must pass.\nBiomechanical and physiological tests are used to analyze specific biomechanical \nproperties of the footwear. These can be trade studies with a few subjects to compare \ndifferent design alternatives, compare to a past design or compare the performance. \nFor a trade study, the KPI might be something like, \u201cthe new design performs as \ngood or better than that past design\u201d.\nThere are no thresholds or performance scales for biomechanical and physiologi -\ncal tests thus, the assessment should be done in a relative way comparing different", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3329, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a122c28-ea6c-484a-96c5-aa470e9ac261": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a122c28-ea6c-484a-96c5-aa470e9ac261", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "354", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "872317ef-f8b0-452e-ba7e-cb4a66ddb213", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "354", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "be24a0d4b32369afd691bed777f83679e8738b75f689750a1fbf536d157881c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "354 Product Fit and Sizing\nconditions.

Adult male and female feet are \nproportioned differently. For example, women typically have a narrower foot for \na given length than men. This can cause women to have fit issues with footwear \ndesigned for men and scaled down for women. This is a typical situation in safety \nfootwear.\nAging affects anatomy and limits the functions of the body. Requirements related \nto footwear for the elderly should consider:\n\u2022 As we age, we experience more deformations and pathologies such as hal -\nlux valgus and hammer toes.\n\u2022 There is a reduction of soft tissue under the foot plant that provides a natural \ncushioning, bursitis, plantar fasciitis, dry skin, or problems related to dia -\nbetic foot that can be very serious.\n\u2022 The toenails are also often affected by age. They can become thicker, \nraised, and more brittle, requiring more toe room.\n\u2022 Aging is also associated with several changes in joint physiology that may \ncontribute to the reduced range of motion in lower extremity joints. Due \nto the important role played by the foot in adapting to uneven terrain, a \nreduced range of motion in the joints of the foot and ankle is strongly \nassociated with impaired balance and functional ability in older people. \nMovement limitations of elderly people are also related to an increase in the \nrisk of falls which can be serious for the elderly.\nFor children, the foot grows very fast and their feet still have an immature struc -\nture that is going through the developmental growth phase. Hence, a poorly fitted \nchild\u2019s shoe may cause severe foot problems. The main aspects to consider in the \ndesign of children\u2019s footwear are:\n\u2022 Feet anthropometry:  The foot is growing but the manner of increasing the \nsize is not regular. They are also changing the proportions and shape. Thus, \nthe children\u2019s feet are not a scaled version of adult feet.\n\u2022 Anatomy:  The anatomy is also different. During the first stages of growth, \nsome bones are cartilages under formation. The longitudinal arch is not \nformed so they usually have flat feet. Children\u2019s feet are also fleshy and very \nflexible. Proprioception, which is the way joints and muscles send messages \nto the brain to help coordinate movement is an important feedback for chil -\ndren during the development of gait.\n\u2022 Gait pattern development:  Between 0 and 14 years old children develop \ntheir gait patterns in different stages. Their footwear should be developed \naccording to the specific requirements of each stage and consider not only \nfit but also biomechanics of the gait, proprioception, and protection for \nthermal comfort and stability.

However, the correspon -\ndence between sizes is not direct. Full size length increment is 6.67 mm in the European sizing system and 5 mm for Mondopoint. UK and US sizing systems use half sizes for most of the shoes with a half-size length incre -\nment of 4.23 mm. This is a problem for size conversion and also to achieve a consistent fit. Local brands are developed based on a sizing system and a grading method.\n\u2022 Foot anthropometry variability:  Foot anthropometry differs along differ -\nent geographic locations and in particular for main target markets, North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.

There are many books where this knowledge is explained in detail. \nOne recommendation is The Science of Footwear Chapters 1  and 2 ( Goonetilleke, \n2012 ). In this chapter, we have included a short overview necessary to introduce foot \nanthropometry.\nThe human foot is a complex structure formed by 26 bones (a quarter of the total \nskeleton), 33 joints, and more than 120 muscles, ligaments, tendons, and nerves (see Figure 7.17 ). These anatomical structures support and maintain the balance of the \nbody mass during the execution of human activities. They work together to support the weight of the body, act as shock absorbers, keep you balanced, and push the body forward with each stride.\nFoot as a statIC stRuCtuRe\nThe weight-bearing foot is quite different from the static or at-rest foot. It is a dif -\nferent foot in shape, size, and proportions. However, the shoe must fit both the static and weight-bearing foot. It can help to know what changes occur in the weight-bearing foot:\nKapandji (1970)  proposed that, as a weight-bearing structure, the foot works as \na dome supported by three arches, two of them longitudinal (medial and lateral) arches and one anterior-transverse arch. The three arches are in contact with the floor at three points: (A) the joint of the first toe and the first metatarsal, (B) the joint of the fifth toe and the fifth metatarsal, and (C) the posterior calcaneal tuberosity (see Figure 7.18 ).\nThe internal longitudinal arch of the foot  (A\u2013C), called the planar arch, is \ncharacterized by its extraordinary mobility. Its main functions are maintaining bal -\nance and adaptation to different terrains by means of its deformity and absorbing the inward and outward rotations of the leg. It is also responsible for modulating the \nFIGURE 7.17  Foot anatomy.

The foot inside the shoe is totally compressed in the area \nof the transverse arch changing the main dimensions due to its deformation capacity.\nFinally, the main characteristic of the external arch  (B\u2013C) is its rigidity, partly \ndue to the force of the plantar ligaments and the bone structure. In standing posture, the deformity of this arch is minimal. The soft tissue that covers the bones of the feet in this external foot region is in permanent contact with the ground and supports the body weight. During locomotion, the rigidity of this arch transfers the movement of the rear musculature of the leg toward the forefoot.\nthe Dynam ICs oF the Foot\nThe foot is a dynamic structure, and the shoes should be able to adapt to the deforma -\ntion that occurs during the performance of different activities such as walking, run -\nning, or climbing. Knowledge about the biomechanics of the movements is essential to establish the requirements and specifications to achieve an adequate dynamic fit. There is reliable accessible literature about the gait cycle and running patterns such as (Nigg, 2010 ; Richards et al., 2022 ) a comprehensive review of the anatomy and kine -\nmatics of the lower limb, hips, and center of gravity ( Ledoux & Telfer, 2022 ). In this \nchapter, the topic is introduced only to highlight the implications of footwear design.\nThe main joints of the foot are the ankle and the metatarsal joints:\nThe ankle joint: The main ankle joint is the tibiotalar (talocrural) joint \n(between the talus and the tibia) responsible for the movement of dorsiflex -\nion and plantar flexion as well as some degree of ab/adduction of the foot. \nThe combination of these motions is the result of the angle of the axis of this joint in the frontal and transversal planes (see Figure 7.21 ).\nFIGURE 7.20  Transversal section of the metatarsal heads.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1899, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0c0ddb0-667c-4c2a-8b28-65b4a0c705d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0c0ddb0-667c-4c2a-8b28-65b4a0c705d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "364", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "13f410f9-9db4-46f5-828f-4b1515021665", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "364", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "f3b928025a78fe8021afa6e0d0fd77294c344aabdd32aaea8646f31b386509fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "364 Product Fit and Sizing\nTalocalcaneal (or Subtalar) Joint and the Transverse-Tarsal  \n(or Talocalcaneonavicular) Joint \nThey are also responsible for the kinematics of the rearfoot that results in a combina -\ntion of plantar and dorsiflexion, occurring in the sagittal plane; ab/adduction occur -\nring in the transverse plane and inversion-eversion, occurring in the frontal plane. \nThe subtalar joint axis (see Figure 7.22 ) is a line pointing from the ground surface on \nthe posterior and lateral aspect of the foot toward the medial anterior of the foot and inclined by about 42 degrees.

The main movement is flexion/extension playing a crucial role during gait but also ab/  \nadduction in a short range.\nThe gait cycle consists of the stance phase and the swing phase with a total aver -\nage duration of one gait cycle for men ranging from 0.98 to 1.07 s ( Murray et al., \n1964 ). The stance phase of gait begins when the foot first touches the ground and \nends when the same foot leaves the ground, being approximately 62% of the total gait cycle (see Figure 7.23 ). The stance phase is divided into three periods: the ini -\ntial contact period also known as heel strike (27%), the period of load transference (40%), and the propulsive period or toe off (33%) ( Root, 1971 ).\nHeel Strike Phase\nThe initial contact period begins with a heel strike. The function of the foot is to \nactivate the natural ability of the body to absorb shocks as well as to ensure a stable position. The foot moves from heel to toe from a supinated position to a pronated position (foot rolling inward). Once the foot becomes flat, the forefoot comes in con-tact with the ground, and the next phase starts (see Figure 7.24 ). During walking the \nimpact force produced during the heel strike is similar to the body weight. During running the impact force produced during the heel strike is almost two times the body weight. This situation requires extra protection in the design of the footwear.\nLoad Transference Phase\nIn the middle of the gait, the load transference phase, the functions of the foot are \nload support and overall stability. The internal foot arch undergoes the highest defor -\nmation, and the foot achieves the higher length. The foot plant is in full contact with the ground and this limb supports the entire body weight. The body weight moves forward over this fixed limb to prepare for the propulsion period. The load transfer -\nence phase ends as the heel begins to rise off the ground (see Figure 7.25 ). Footwear \ndesign influences the dynamic pressure distribution pattern. Ideally, a plantar pres -\nsure map should avoid overpressure points that can be responsible for pain and foot problems (e.g., corns and calluses callus, metatarsalgia). The optimal design of an insole or footbed in terms of materials and anatomical shape is a good solution to enhance pressure distribution patterns.\nFIGURE 7.23  Stance phase of the gait cycle and pressure transference during this phase.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2598, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "059ad3da-be3e-4b8f-9eb3-0925c9f5e8d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "059ad3da-be3e-4b8f-9eb3-0925c9f5e8d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "366", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "21caec57-698d-4c6e-b2ff-6cc604d9c451", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "366", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "e9587449e58a336641768a1e377271e64c6fe7dee67e14e78c39ca7836b93fe6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "366 Product Fit and Sizing\nPropulsion (or Toe Off) Phase\nIt is the final stage of the stance phase.

In \naddition, the available data usually is not comparable as different protocols and meth -\nodologies were used to measure the foot and at times have used different anthropo -\nmetric definitions. As a result, the comparison of foot anthropometry from different \nstudies is not always feasible.\nPosture and Weight Bearing\nFoot shape changes between different loading conditions in the static posture. These \nshape changes affect foot measurements ( Kouchi et al., 2021 ) that can be larger than \na shoe size grading interval. The recommended condition for the measuring protocol \nof foot anthropometry is half-weight bearing, the user stands erect distributing body \nweight equally on both feet on a flat surface. This is the most commonly used condi -\ntion for footwear applications. It is recommended a separation of the feet in line with \nthe hip joints to control the rotation and the deformation of the longitudinal arch. An \nalternative protocol also used especially in stores is a partial-weight bearing, sitting: \nthe user sits on a chair resting most of his or her body weight on the chair and the \nfoot lies on a flat surface. In this posture, it is more difficult to control the distribution \nof the weight that depends on the sitting position (angle of the hip and knee joints). \nNon-weight bearing (NWB), the foot is in the air when it is measured, not supporting \nany body weight. In this condition, foot pose is not standardized. It is used mainly in \nclinical applications when it is important to capture the shape of the arch unloaded. \nSince this condition is difficult for measuring the foot anthropometry and shape, \nthe alternative method used for these applications is a foot impression taken using a \nfoam block. This is valid to capture the foot plant in NWB condition.\nFoot Measurements Should be Done Barefoot With No Socks\nSocks produce pressure over the foot, modifying the foot shape and measurements \nin different values depending on the type of textile and fit provided by the sock. \nThe thickness of the socks introduces an artifact in the resulting measurements. \nAdditionally, anthropometric measurements rely on anatomical points that cannot \nbe identified and marked with socks.\nThe shape and dimensions of the foot can be also affected by the time of the day \nand the activity done before taking the measurements. It is suggested to register this \ninformation in the measuring protocol especially when fit testing with subjects.\nManual Versus Digital Anthropometry\nFoot anthropometry can be collected manually or using 3D scanning methods. \nNowadays, the main footwear brands are using 3D scanning technology to capture", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3171, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5e47015-b0bd-4a6e-b79c-7e7c1655bd31": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5e47015-b0bd-4a6e-b79c-7e7c1655bd31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "368", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42d27215-fe5c-4062-85fa-350771c867de", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "368", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "a09a4a744d63139ba9208514fa0484c14fbcce454cb63aacc29bf64ec28e3fc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "368 Product Fit and Sizing\nnot only foot measurements but also foot shapes.

Some of the foot measurements are referred to as sections or planes that first require, the orientation of the foot and the definition of a foot axis, an imagined line indicating the longitudinal axis of the foot.

A small difference in the rotation can create a large difference in the heel height (see Figure 7.31 ).

It is important to define the target market and use anthropometric infor -\nmation of the corresponding population. Unfortunately, the current state of anthro -\npometric information on the body is partial, fragmented and very limited, the state of foot anthropometric databases is even worse. In this situation, most of the foot -\nwear companies, especially in the case of hi-tech footwear, create their own foot anthropometric databases.\nFoot anthropometry shows relevant differences by gender. An analysis done with \na foot anthropometric database of 783 subjects measured with a 3D scanner showed mean differences of 28 mm in length (see Figure 7.32 ), 25 mm in the metatarsal girth \n(ball girth), and 10 mm in the foot width (see Figure 7.33 ).\nIn addition, for the same shoe size, the width of women\u2019s feet in is smaller \nthan in the width of men (see Figure 7.34 ). They have a foot that is 10\u201312 mm \nthinner, which is a full size in width. This information should be considered for the design of unisex shoes. A common mistake is to design the shoe last for men and expand the grading for both range of sizes. The result is footwear that is too wide for women. This is especially true in the case of safety footwear due to the high cost of the lasts and molds for production. Companies try to avoid creating sizes for women with different widths but similar lengths to men\u2019s footwear. A sizing loop fit audit can reveal these limitations and help to devise cost effective alternatives.\nFIGURE 7.31  Orientation of the shoe last to locate the functional sections and calculate \nthe dimensions.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1935, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f90269e-9725-41f3-81b3-ca7b2388d386": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f90269e-9725-41f3-81b3-ca7b2388d386", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "372", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4828e146-f24a-4280-971b-e5b19d1e1168", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "372", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "7c5aa13ddb2a278bd0ac13ae000ca429cb17232508a3914816b0919bb9e7ffdc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "372 Product Fit and Sizing\nAnthropometry with High Heel Shoes\nAlmost all shoes have a certain height in the heel support.

Only due to the fact that the anthropometric dimensions \nof the foot are not measured in the same posture adopted by the foot inside the shoe, it is necessary to consider and to introduce corrections if we try to transfer the foot anthropometry to the shoe last dimensions.

Some upper materials can be deformed, temporal, definitive or \na combination of both, to enable the accommodation of different foot shapes and dimensions. On the other hand, the structure and design of the upper material are the cause of most of the critical fit problems. It is often not possible to wear a shoe due to high pressures of the upper edges or blisters caused by friction and a slide effect between the foot and the shoe.\nThe rigidity of the upper material can be characterized with a mechanical test \nusing a universal strength machine. There is no standard test to \u201csimulate\u201d the loads involved in the foot-upper interaction. The main area of pressure and deformation of the upper that requires accommodation is the metatarsal section. A mechanical test performed with a universal testing machine can be used to simulate the pressure of the metatarsal bone against the upper to record the force-displacement curve and to obtain the upper material rigidity (see Figure 7.36 ).\nThe upper material rigidity is related to the pressure produced by the shoe over \nthe foot dorsum.

In this context, the process use of the SPEED process must be agile and easy to imple -\nment. This requires the preparation and set up of protocols that enable the optimal performance of fit tests and the deployment of the results along the value chain.\nThis is an example of using the SPEED process for a casual footwear product (i.e., \na sneaker). It describes the use of the COF for a footwear product, a sample from the TP to establish the base size and sizing system, and the use of fit testing to establish specifications, last proportioning, and create a footwear fit standard with a standard fit validation process.\nThe TP for this product was both men and women between the ages of 18 and \n60 years from the United States and Europe. The fit requirements for this product were: (1) 80% of the population can slightly move their toes inside the shoe, (2) 80% prefer the fit \u201cas is\u201d in all areas with no pain points, and (3) the clearance in length is 5\u201315 mm. These requirements were assessed using an agreed upon COF and metrics as shown in Table 7.4 .\nThe dataset used to characterize the TP was from the raw data from the CAESAR \nsurvey ( Robinette et al., 2002 ). This data included more than 4000 adult men and \nwomen from North America and Europe. It contained two key measurements of the foot: total foot length (Foot Length) and metatarsal width (Foot Breadth). Foot Length measurements were divided into hypothetical shoe size categories using the European shoe size category definitions which was in accordance with the ISO 19407:2023 stan -\ndard. The hypothetical size 38 for women had a foot length of 243.3 \u00b1 5 mm, and  \nthe size 42 for men had a foot length of 280 \u00b1 5 mm. The foot length range in this case was 10 mm more than the 6.67 mm which is the theoretical size grading for EU sizing. We took this decision due to the overlaps in foot lengths between sizes related to personal preferences or the impact of their foot width. A user with nar -\nrow feet for instance, might select a smaller size in length to have a better shoe fit in the width and conversely, a user with wider feet might select a bigger size (Valero et al., 2023 ).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3277, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77909ca8-1644-4f10-ad29-f1ce7f142a57": {"__data__": {"id_": "77909ca8-1644-4f10-ad29-f1ce7f142a57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "380", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e78408fc-50b4-47ba-895a-5639d38b18af", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "380", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "b290b2796d6a8cf98945d9386e741696ff9a8a44df52a909619aa3b14d258d91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "380 Product Fit and Sizing\nTABLE 7.4\nCOF for the Sneaker\nFit Area COF Metric\nLength Optimal fit, neither tight nor  \nloose.Subject questions:\nHow would you rate the length of the shoe?\u20131 slightly tight, 0 ok, +1 slightly loose\nWhat would be your preference for the length?\n\u20131 shorter, 0 as is, +1 longer\nAre there any pain points?

So, while we had several iterations to achieve our required fit this time, we would need only a few trade studies for future styles or shoe concepts.\nFigure 7.43  shows the bivariate scatterplot of Foot Length by Foot Breadth with the \nbest fit regression lines for each gender shown. These lines represent the most likely Foot Breadth values for each Foot Length value, that is the correlation between both variables. The line for females was approximately 5 mm smaller for Foot Breadth than the line for males. That means the female shoe size range should be proportioned to be narrower for each Foot Length than the male shoe size range. In other words, female feet are not simply scaled down male feet. It was important to examine all the impor -\ntant foot dimensions in this manner to get a good shoe and last proportioning.\nPrevious studies have indicated there are several other important measurements \nof the foot for this type of footwear including ball girth, instep girth, instep height, toe height, toe girth, and heel width. This knowledge was not available for the entire TP when we began the study, so data collection was done on small samples ( n = 100) \nof men and women who were within the base size for Foot Length, and the full set of foot measurements was included in subsequent prototype fit tests once the base size prototypes were available. This allowed us to establish footwear specifications in all these areas as well as to begin building a combined foot and fit database for our products. The fit database was both structured and traceable enabling the genera -\ntion of design and assessment standards to arrive at effective specifications and meet requirements faster for new products.\nThe additional anthropometric data obtained before fit testing gave us estimates of \nthe range of variability for the anthropometric measurements within the base sizes.

Table 7.5  shows the size variability for women who had foot lengths in the size \n38 range (243.3 \u00b1 5 mm).\nThis table was used as a reference but not transposed directly in the design or the \nlast. As we explained in Chapter 3 , percentiles are calculated independently for each \nmeasurement and combining them is not recommended. Designing for the mean or \n50th percentile for all measurements might not fit anyone. Also, in some areas, we may want to use the largest measurement, in others something in the middle might be preferable.\nThat said, many insights can be obtained from the anthropometric table. First, the \nball girth variation from 5th to 95th percentile is 27.4 mm. According to the indus -\ntrial grading standard of EU sizing, the usual ball girth step between sizes is 5 mm. That means that the foot variation that must be accommodated within a size is more than 5 times the size grade.\nA shoe last with a wide ball girth and deformable upper material, and a soft and \ndeformable insole can achieve a higher accommodation rate. Such as in the case of a sneaker. A shoe last with a tight ball girth to provide a slim style and is made of rigid upper material will have a lower accommodation rate and will require several width sizes. We could only determine how much is accommodated with the different materials using trade study type fit tests. Then we could determine which materials worked best and if we needed or wanted to produce multiple width sizes in addition to the length sizes.\nIn the same way, the variation in Foot breadth from 5th to 95th percentile was \naround 6 mm while the usual industrial grading standard of EU sizing is 2 mm. According to the requirements of the COF for this example, the ball width, it was important to consider that the fit of the shoe always compresses the metatarsal arch of the foot to hold the foot in place to avoid slippage between the foot and the shoe. That means that the ball width of the last is going to be smaller than the equivalent metatarsal width of the foot. This situation is not only applicable to this sneaker case study example. Ball width of the last almost always will be smaller than the metatar -\nsal width of the foot. How much? It depends on the type of footwear, materials, etc. This is the reason why it is necessary to start from an initial value of ball width of the TABLE 7. 5\nStatistical Summary of the Anthropometric Dimensions for Women\u2019s Size 38\nWomen\u2019s Size 38(Foot Length 243.3 \u00b1 5 mm) P05 P25 P50 P75 P95 Mean SD\nBall Girth (mm) 217.8 223.4 230.4 236.2 245.2 230.5 8.7\nFoot Breadth (mm) 90.3 93.3 95.9 98.7 101.6 96.2 4.0\nInstep Girth (mm) 217.5 223.8 229.4 233.8 242.7 229.3 7.8\nInstep Height (mm) 57.8 60.8 63.4 66.2 68.8 63.4 3.5\nToes Height (mm) 20.3 21.9 23.6 25.2 28.8 23.7 2.5\nToes Girth (mm) 197.4 206.1 213.5 218.5 228.2 212.7 9.2\nToes Width (mm) 87.8 91.5 95.5 98.2 102.3 95.1 4.6\nHeel Width (mm) 58.7 61.3 64.0 66.0 68.9 63.7 3.3", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2957, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8571e058-8922-47ab-aa17-8d1d9f833a72": {"__data__": {"id_": "8571e058-8922-47ab-aa17-8d1d9f833a72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "384", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "075a1389-1231-43dc-aaee-900b3c44583b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "384", "file_name": "Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\hwy\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\single code\\ebooks\\Product Fit and Sizing_25_06_03_12_44_21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 21178175, "creation_date": "2025-06-27", "last_modified_date": "2025-06-17"}, "hash": "51ffd997ac390147df42ed41badf423541f4b1520747258d2923d72ac591145c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "384 Product Fit and Sizing\nlast and validate it with fit trials. Once a fit database is generated with a collection of \nhistorical fit data it can be used in the future as a valid reference for different types of shoes to create better lasts faster. A valid reference value will reduce the design loop by leading to a successful fit test on the first attempt.\nThe toes can be slightly compressed within certain limits and still be comfortable \nbecause they are mobile anatomical structures. Therefore, the sneaker\u2019s requirement for the last dimensions is to design a last with a smaller toe width than the foot anthropometry. Again, this is also applicable for most footwear styles. The specific values of the difference between the toe width of the last and the toe width of the foot will depend on many factors and it is necessary to start with an initial reference value and test the fit with live subjects. In the sneaker case, the design of the toes shape of the last is usually wide and the reference values will not differ much from the anthropometric values. Other types of shoes will require narrower toe areas, such as fashion shoe styles with slim and pointed toes. In this extreme, when the toes are highly compressed, the height of the toes may increase to compensate for this change, and the criteria of toe height might require a correction.\nFor toe height, pressure on the top of the toes should be always avoided. In fact, in \nour sneaker COF case study there was just enough room to be able to move the toes. For our sneakers, a starting reference point for a lower limit of the toes height might be the 95th percentile (28.8 mm) for the size 38. Is this enough? We could confirm this with trade studies of the materials and prototype fit tests of the prototype base size.\nIn the heel area, the fit in this area should be neutral (neither too wide nor too \nnarrow). We used the 50th percentile (64 mm) as our starting reference point for our base size prototype.\nUsing the anthropometric data and our prior knowledge of what constitutes an \nacceptable sneaker fit we developed the specifications for the prototype lasts for our two base sizes. Then we created prototype sneakers in the base sizes to be used in prototype fit tests to verify and/or adjust the lasts. The specifications for the lasts included last measurements and production tolerances for the important measure -\nments. The format for the specifications is shown in Table 7.6 .

To illustrate some refer -\nence values, we included the values for Length, Toes, and Heel.\nTolerance refers to the range of variation around the reference value within which \na noticeable change is not perceived by the subject. For instance, a deformable upper \nmaterial can offer significant tolerance in certain areas, allowing for a wider range \nof aesthetic styles, whereas a rigid material has a smaller tolerance. A lacing fastener \nprovides a broad accommodation range, allowing for increased tolerance in both \ninstep girth and instep height. Therefore, the tolerance values can vary for different \ndesigns, materials, or shoe last dimensions. These first tolerances were educated \nguesses just to get us started. The final tolerances were established through trade \nstudies of different material properties using human subjects. As we gather data -\nbases of last trade studies and tolerances, we can establish last standards for different \nproduct types that enable us to get to a good last size and shape more rapidly.\nCreating a shoe last design from scratch is not usual. It is more common to use an \nexisting last from a footwear company or last maker which was the approach used \nfor this case study. We used the style and aesthetic of the proposed design to identify \na suitable last that met the length and girth specifications of the base size. One of \nthe reasons was because these were the only measurements they could check at that \ntime manually with a tape. Now we have 3D scanning and CAD tools that allow us \nto capture additional proportions and measurements.\nThe fit trials told us how to refine it for our specific product. After we had a \nrefined last with the anthropometry and fit scores associated with it, we created a fit \nstandard to use for all future products.\nAs a result, until we have a good correlation between the last and the anthro -\npometry of the feet that are accommodated, our first last will be an educated guess \nthat will probably require modification. Otherwise, we will have a shoe that fits the \nlast but not the desired segment of the TP. We gathered the necessary information \nusing fit testing and established an anthropometry, fit and last database to be able to \ndetermine this correlation.\nSeveral prototypes were produced during the development process. The first \nmock-up of the sneaker was used as a first evaluation of the design, the fit and the \nshoe last. For this step, it was not necessary to use the real sole. A sole with the same \nheel height and thickness was used. This was a faster and cheaper way to check the fit \nwith the last than using the final materials. It ensured we were in the ballpark before \nwe made more expensive prototypes. This quick fit test was done with only the right \nfoot. It was the beginning of the development process and there were many aspects \nto check and refine so prototyping both feet would be unproductive. After this first \nfit test, there were several modifications to carry out in the last and the substantial \nmodifications were again prototyped and tested. Depending on how far the design \nis from the optimal performance, the process of achieving a successful fit test might \nrequire several loops of the redesign-prototyping-fit test. Doing these with faster, \nwith cheaper materials saved us time and money.\nThe final prototype that was fit tested was a definitive version of the shoe manu -\nfactured with the final components. At this point in the development process, there \nis often a lot of pressure to launch the manufacturing of the complete range of sizes, \nso this validation is often not done.

This was the case of the sneaker devel -\nopment but also applies to the development of fashion footwear styles.\nA fit test with subjects aims to correlate fit performance with anthropometry. \nIt is important to represent the TP well, but also to reduce the number of subjects \nas much as possible. Usually, the anthropometric database that is used to charac -\nterize the TP is anonymous, so it is not possible to pull subjects from that sample \nto use for the test and that was the situation for this case study. We used a panel of new subjects from the TP who matched the Foot Length measurements of the base size. It was necessary to perform a new search to find good representatives. For this search, we also considered personal fit preferences and the skills to com -\nmunicate the fit problems of the shoe, the good points, and the elements to improve their fit/comfort. Experience of wearing shoes of this type for the type of activity it was designed was one of our subject selection criteria. It was important to find subjects with good sensitivity that could be trained to assess the shoe effectively in a fit trial.\nWe preliminary chose seven new subjects for the fit test from a database of 100 \nwomen who were within the size 38 Foot Length range.

Footwear innovation began with sports shoes, but it \nhas expanded to all types of footwear (e.g., safety, formal, children\u2019s, military). The \nSPEED methodology helps the footwear innovator make wise and informed decisions \nbecause the most important sources of information to build new concepts come from \nthe users. The footwear innovation process described in this chapter was inspired by \nthe methodologies and experience applied by the Footwear Innovation team of the IBV.\nFootwear innovation projects spend more time developing requirements and COF \nbefore moving on to prototype development than is typically spent on simply creating a \nnew aesthetic style. Good approaches to footwear innovation start with a learning phase \nand a creative phase before prototyping innovative new designs.

This model had a material in the sole with greater rigidity \nand density. This material seemed to be affecting both the weight of the footwear \nand the reduction of flexibility in the forefoot.\nThe stability issue may have more to do with looseness, since model 3 had the worst \nstability and was looser in all areas except the toes, than the other models. Shoe model \n1 has more looseness in the toes than the other two models and it has the second worst \nstability. Looseness may also have influenced the general fit score.

Then design loop testing is used to refine the product. The process \nis iterative and may include mini-loops after the fit and performance tests as well as it is conceived the SPEED methodology. Depending on the complexity, it usually starts with a coarse design that will be refined in different iterations. In this process, the use of simulation methodologies and prototyping technologies can speed up the process significantly.\nSince creating a lighter shoe seemed to be a good innovation opportunity, for this \ncase study the goal was to arrive at a shoe that was equivalent to the best benchmark shoes, but much lighter. The concept to achieve this goal was to make a lighter sole. After the creative phase, the design concept decided to reduce the weight of the sole by material reduction in the internal side of the sole. The first step in the prototype evalu -\nation was to perform several simulations in a finite element model. The input forces for the simulation were pressure patterns from biomechanical studies of the TP. The simulations enabled us to compare the deformation of the sole considering different types of materials and thicknesses of the vertical walls. This resulted in a material reduction in some areas but with a higher concentration of material at the heel and the metatarsal arch.\nThe design that appeared best in the simulation was then prototyped using rapid \nprototyping technologies and tested mechanically to validate the simulation results and check mechanical properties such as fatigue, that is the resistance under long cyclic loads.

For instance, the design of the previous sole required a redesign in the heel \nto avoid small-deep cavities that prevent the removal of the sole from the mold. Next, the complete shoe was prototyped at this stage using the same process described in the first case study, with tests of the base size last, refinement, and iterative prototype tests with subjects and comparison against the benchmark shoes. For these tests, which required active movement while wearing the shoes it was important to proto -\ntype the shoes for both feet. The prototypes were tested in real conditions, moving the testing set up to a sports facility, both indoor and outdoor. The type of sports surface influences footwear performance and the assessment results.\nThe test protocol must include the critical and most frequent sports gestures and \nthe testing protocols, the questionnaire must be adapted for each specific project. As a result, the test sessions can be a lot longer than a regular fitting test, and if there are repeated tests with the same subjects it is often necessary to have a paid test panel for at least the first set of tests. That was the situation for this case study.\nFor the first tests where we assessed the base size, we used expert users of this \ntype of sports footwear. We selected ten subjects that we could use repeatedly for testing throughout the project. This provided some consistency in their responses because by understanding the COF and participating in all the testing, the subjects became expert fitters. Since there was a risk associated with using a small sample size like this, we checked their foot sizes and relative foot proportions by examining their percentile scores for each of the seven foot measurements.\nA practical representation of the anthropometric profile of the subjects is shown \nin Table 7.8 . In this table, the values are shaded to indicate their relative size. The \nsmallest values are white, and the largest values are the darkest.\nWe see that we have a good range of subjects with values ranging from the  \n4th percentile for subjects 4 and 7 to nearly the 100th percentile for subject 6.
